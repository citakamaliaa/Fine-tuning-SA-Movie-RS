First of all it was a right mission to get to see it at all and I expected it to have a much wider UK release. There was also confusing and conflicting information over the exact cinema release date given over the internet (First the 4th of August, then the 18th, then the 4th again!) Seeing it at the cinema resulted in me having to travel half the country!\n\nFor those who don&apos;t know the story, in April of 1980 the Iranian embassy was stormed by six armed men demanding the release of hostages in Iran over the mistreatment of their tribe by the Persians in Iran, but the UK had poor relations with Iran at the time and Iran was not going to give them anything. The UK was on it&apos;s own and for the first time in Television history, the actions of the largely anonymous Special Air Service, would be seen live for all to see. \n\nThe film is basically told from four main perspectives. An always excellent Mark Strong is hostage Negotiator, Max Vernon, a man acutely aware that lives are literally in his hands, and the emotional impact this has on him is one of the stronger aspects of the film and Strongs scenes are all appropriately gripping. Secondly is that of the SAS with Jamie Bell, in a very different role, playing Rusty Firmin, one of the soldiers leading the assault. Bell shows he has left the legacy of Billy Elliot well and truly behind him and is superb in this role. Tension notches up appropriately as he and his team ready themselves to go in. Thirdly is the insight into the upper echelons of the political discussions which went on between Billy Whitelaw (Tim Piggot-Smith in what may well have been his final role) as the options are raked over with an unseen Margaret Thatcher sending down her stance on terrorism. Ronan Vibert is noteworthy as the head of MI6 while Robert Portal plays SAS Colonel Mike Rose with the appropriate level of staunch professionalism while Martin Shaw adds gravitas to the proceedings though he is given very little to say or do.\n\nThose inside the Embassy, both hostages and terrorists are fairly thinly drawn with the exception of the terrorist leader, Salim (A great performance from Ben Turner) and most of our insights into their interactions come via the other characters mentioned above. There is little attempt to humanise the Iranian hostages, we know nothing for example, about the one who is executed, so when this happens, we, the audience, feel little emotional loss. PC Trevor Locke stands out a little as he is given more to do, but just a few more lines of dialogue would have enabled us to emotionally connect with the hostages from the outset. \n\nThe fourth strand of the narrative is that of reporter Kate Adie and her cameraman, as they vie for the best shot over the reporter from a different rag (Either The Sun or The Mail, it wasn&apos;t clear to me) - I remember Kate Adie well from this reporting and felt Abbie Cornish was a little miscast in this role. She felt too glamorous with not a hair out of place and way too much makeup. This story line added very little to film. She spots the SAS leaving to train at one point and indicates she suspects more is afoot, but never vocalises her suspicions, so little is made of this. The interaction between her and the rival reporter could have been the cornerstone of lighter moments in this serious drama but they&apos;re lost and forgotten. This was the weakest element for me.\n\nThe siege unfolds over six days and it is the relationship between Mark Strong&apos;s character and terrorist leader Salim that is the most captivating. \n\nOverall the film is paced well and Toa Fraser does an admirable job of handling the multiple characters and story lines, but the film starting as it does with the Embassy being taken, we have no time to get to know any of the hostages or feel a connection to them. A ten- minute sequence at the beginning of the film giving us an introduction to these characters would have made the emotional stakes a little higher for the viewer. BBC Sound Recordist Sim Harris is given little to say or do, so there is little context of who he is and the moment where he goes out onto the window ledge (An image scorched into the memory of all who saw it live on television) is not as dramatic and meaningful as it could have been. \n\nThe film side steps a few of the more controversial aspects of the raid. The terrorist who was captured was almost executed by the SAS out the back before they realised they were being filmed by the television station. I found the unobtrusive score lacked a dramatic emphasis at the appropriate moments and made it essentially underwhelming.\n\nOverall, however, this is a solidly made drama with good performances and a suitable dour colour palette matching the setting of the 1980s and it shameful that such a drama, covering as it did, a flash point in UK history, did not receive a wider release. I would, despite my reservations, still recommend it.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",3.1,17+,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History']",2017-11-25,"suspense,tension,year 1980,1980s,inspired by a true story",PT1H34M,"[{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068260/'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0835016/'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180411/'}]","[{'name': 'Toa Fraser', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1089736/'}]","[{'name': 'Glenn Standring', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822101/'}, {'name': 'Rusty Firmin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307076/'}]",2.3,3.15

This film follows Doug through his extraordinary heights and lows of his life in the comedy business. \n\nThis film is directed by David Wain (Role Models), Wrote by Michael Colton and John Aboud (Penguins of Madagascar). It stars Will Forte (Nebraska) as Doug Kenney, Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina) and Martin Mull (Clue) as The Narrator. Along with a great line up of stellar comedians. \n\nWhat I liked about this film was it&apos;s direction and in my opinion pitch perfect interpretations of famous actors and directors. I really enjoyed Joel McHale as Chevy Chase and Will Forte as Doug Kenney. Most of the jokes are funny as well especially the ones featuring famous scenes in films and how they came about. My favorite scene would have to be the ending though which for someone who didn&apos;t know the story actually had me tearing up a bit. \n\nBut some of the jokes do not hit for me, along with a dive in quality in the middle of the film which makes it last forever. means that it certainly isn&apos;t comic genius.\n\nHowever I do like this film and think you should watch it.

That statement may confuse some people, so please listen closely if you&apos;re intrigued, because this review if going to be about me gushing on how incredible this film is. Whole critics seem to general love this film, average moviegoers seem to be pretty divisive on this film in retrospect. Personally, I completely see how many would be bored or turned off by this film, so whether or not you like this film is up to you. Personally, this film opened my mind in ways I wasn&apos;t expecting and I found myself in a state of transfixion when the credits began to role. So, this review will definitely lean heavily on a recommendation to everyone, but please be advised that the film itself is absolutely not for everyone. Now that I have that out of the way, let&apos;s dive in. \n\nAs a couple is about to move out of their first house onto bigger and better things, the husband (Casey Affleck) dies in a tragic accident. The film then follows the wife (Rooney Mara) as she copes with her loss. The husband returns in ghost form, walking around the halls of the house, watching her every move, stating that people really do watch over us after they die. This premise is fantastic, but the visuals themselves and the way the movie is constructed is what I feel may turn many people off. Coming off cheap by literally having the husband dressed in a bed sheet, the movie may seem cheesy to some, but that&apos;s not the point of it at all. From long takes of people sitting alone in a room to time travel in order to open viewers mind&apos;s, this movie takes many risks, but I think they are all genius in their own right if you&apos;re in the proper mood when watching this film. \n\nGoing from many short films, to independent features, to a big blockbuster in last year&apos;s Pete&apos;s Dragon, director David Lowrey has been all over the business, so it was pretty clear that this was a passion project for him, and that the amount of viewers this film gained didn&apos;t matter to him in the slightest. I think this was the best way to make a movie like this, because only the most hardcore film fans will probably discover it, which is where I feel it&apos;s best suited anyways. There is so much symbolism about the meaning of life and which aspects of it really matter the most, but I feel as though many viewers won&apos;t catch on. Once again, if you&apos;re in the right mindset and are open to literally anything, then I believe you&apos;ll have the same reaction to this film that I did. \n\nMany viewers like being able to relate to a character when they speak to someone and open up about themselves, but this film is very far from anything like that. There are stretches of the film that can last up to 30 minutes without a single word being spoken, leaving it up to your interpretation on how they&apos;re feeling or what they&apos;re thinking. This is a very lonely-feeling film that you need to be relaxed and open-minded about. In my opinion, when a film can show you a piece of imagery and have you understand what a character is going through, what they&apos;re thinking, all while giving you a sincere look at our planet as a whole, when it&apos;s accomplishing everything it set out to do, and then some. Simply put, sometimes showing things to an audience is much more powerful than having it explained. \n\nIn the end, A Ghost Story is strangely enough one of the most powerful experiences you&apos;ll be able to see an all of 2017. Now, there isn&apos;t much dialogue, so you really have to pay attention and think about every piece of imagery, but if you&apos;re willing to do that, then I believe you will have a terrific experience as well. If you&apos;re not into this film after the first 10-20 minutes then you&apos;re either not in the right mindset or it&apos;s just not for you, which I completely understand. Many people will hate this movie, but I believe the message itself is worth waiting for alone. A Ghost Story is easily one of my favourite films of the year and I can&apos;t wait to watch it multiple times', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}",3.4,R,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery']",2017-07-28,"death of husband,loss,sitting on the floor and eating,loneliness,legacy",PT1H32M,"[{'name': 'Casey Affleck', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/'}, {'name': 'Rooney Mara', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1913734/'}, {'name': 'McColm Cephas Jr.', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8141375/'}]","[{'name': 'David Lowery', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1108007/'}]","[{'name': 'David Lowery', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1108007/'}]",3.3,4.55

With a pressure from his parents; he and couple of friends finally came up with the idea to built fake college.

I like it, the only problem for me was the character development wasn’t that good, and there are too many characters that haven’t been polish very well. Like Glen he was suppose to be like Booger (Revenge of the Nerd) stupid, yet intelligence in his own way and funny. But here he hardly does anything.\n\nI love the cast, I love Justin Long, which guy is funny, I always follow his work and he does a pretty good job as “B”. Everyone here seems to fit the jigsaw very well. And the acting is decent though from time to time it gets cheesy and the dialogue is also weird at time.\n\nThe movie consists of very touching and inspiring moments and the bond about friendship, and the stupid and how the education system should be. Unfortunately, the movie more or less lack in humor, don’t get it wrong, it just not “laugh out loud” kind it is more of smile type. This movie is for someone older and pre-teen that does not look for toilet humor and more life good morale kind of movie.\n\nRecommendation: Yea Sure, It Worth A Rental.\n\nReason To Watch: Justin Long, Fake College.\n\nReason Not To: If you’re A Teenager Looking For Real Humor and Nudity.\n\nRating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+)', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",3.2,PG-13,['Comedy'],2006-08-18,"adhd,man wears eyeglasses,woman wears a bikini,boy wears eyeglasses,g.i. bill",PT1H33M,"[{'name': 'Justin Long', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0519043/'}, {'name': 'Jonah Hill', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1706767/'}, {'name': 'Blake Lively', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515116/'}]","[{'name': 'Steve Pink', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684336/'}]","[{'name': 'Mark Perez', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0991423/'}, {'name': 'Adam Cooper', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177836/'}, {'name': 'Bill Collage', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171651/'}]",3.6,1.9

Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali, the world&apos;s most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story, &apos;Ali&apos; brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone, whether they like boxing or not.\n\nThe Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius, with defiant rage and inner grace, Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers, Ali took on the law, conventions, the status quo and the war - as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.\n\nWhat an unbelievable role, by Hollywood superstar, Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become &apos;Ali&apos;, would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training, to feel like a boxer, and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage, and then become him. That he did, in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.\n\nThe other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight&apos;s role as the outlandish sports commentator, Howard Cosell, to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell, from Voight, is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith&apos;s real wife, Jada Pinkett, in the same movie. She was good as one of Muhammad&apos;s love interests.\n\nThe story to this film was interesting, as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad&apos;s interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring, with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly, to help balance this film&apos;s story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film, director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing &apos;Ali&apos; to life. He was also a producer and a writer, so he had a big role in making &apos;Ali&apos; the film it was.\n\nAlso having real boxers appear in this film, made the movie all the more enjoyable, as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film, are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line, by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens, Michael Bentt, James Torney, Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch, so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film &apos;believable&apos;.\n\nI must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was &apos;a loud mouth&apos;, and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight, by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali&apos;s personality, to be really coming &apos;the greatest&apos;. It is a shame that Muhammad&apos;s life has been affected by the horrible &apos;Parkinson&apos;s disease&apos;. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.\n\nAli is another film based on a true story, with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman, Denzel Washington who became Rubin &apos;Hurricane&apos; Carter, the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in &apos;Boys Don&apos;t Cry&apos; and Julia Roberts, who was Erin Brockovich, in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith, as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want, against adversary and for the only person who counts - that being you!\n\nCMRS gives &apos;Ali&apos;: 4 (very good film)', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': None, 'bestRating': None, 'ratingValue': None}}",3.35,R,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'Sport']",2001-12-25,"1960s,1970s,africa,muslim,black muslim",PT2H37M,"[{'name': 'Will Smith', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/'}, {'name': 'Jamie Foxx', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937/'}, {'name': 'Jon Voight', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Mann', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000520/'}]","[{'name': 'Gregory Allen Howard', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397322/'}, {'name': 'Stephen J.

It stars Dylan O&apos;Brien as a 23-year-old that obsessively wants revenge for the death of his girlfriend, in a terrorist attack, and is recruited by the CIA (as part of their black ops program). He&apos;s trained by a Cold War veteran played by Michael Keaton. The movie also costars Taylor Kitsch, Shiva Negar and Sanna Lathan. It was directed by Michael Cuesta (who also helmed 2014&apos;s &apos;KILL THE MESSNEGER&apos;) and it was written by Stephen Schiff, Michael Finch, Marshall Herskovitz and director Edward Zwick (who was originally set to direct the film as well). It&apos;s gotten mixed reviews from critics, and it&apos;s also a mild hit at the Box Office as well. The film starts out promising, but later it becomes pretty routine and forgettable. \n\nMitch Rapp (O&apos;Brien) lost his parents in a car crash when he was 14. At 23 he&apos;s just found happiness again, after proposing to his girlfriend on a beach (and she accepts), but then his new fiancé is murdered in a terrorist attack in front of him (at that same moment). Rapp desperately wants revenge, and he obsessively trains (and plans) for it. The CIA becomes worried about his mental well being though, after tracking him, but instead of detaining Rapp, they recruit him. He&apos;s then trained by a Cold War veteran, named Stan Hurley (Keaton), and his first mission is to stop an old trainee of Hurley&apos;s (Kitsch), who&apos;s a lot like Rapp, from starting another world war in the Middle East. \n\nThe opening scene of the movie is really intense, violent and engaging. After that, the origin story of Mitch Rapp is still pretty cool and involving, but then (about half way through the film) it starts to feel really routine and somewhat boring. The action scenes are all still decent, throughout the film, but the story just loses your interest. Still, it could be a decent setup for a spy movie franchise (like they&apos;re hoping it is), and I definitely have no problems with Dylan O&apos;Brien or the rest of the cast.\n\nWatch an episode of our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://vimeo.com/234520321', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",3.1,17+,"['Action', 'Thriller']",2017-09-13,"terrorism,revenge,beach,fight,training",PT1H51M,"[{'name': 'Dylan O&apos;Brien', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3729721/'}, {'name': 'Michael Keaton', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/'}, {'name': 'Sanaa Lathan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005125/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Cuesta', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191147/'}]","[{'name': 'Stephen Schiff', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0771496/'}, {'name': 'Michael Finch', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3360218/'}, {'name': 'Edward Zwick', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001880/'}]",3.0,1.7

The design is extremely stylish and even nobly unique, but underneath those flairs of fun is one of the most identity-confused films ever, a true mess of genres and tones that never quite finds its footing. The cool premise and individual moments of fun can&apos;t overcome how poorly executed the final product is. Ultimately, AU is proof that a mash-up of good scenes without a cohesive center does not a good movie make. Eisenberg and Stewart play a pot-loving couple who learn that their lives may be more than they seem as they run into trouble with the CIA. It&apos;s Pineapple Express meets Bourne, but can&apos;t decide which one it more wants to emulate. At both times absurdly funny and oddly sincere, all the performers seem to be in different movies. On the villain side, we&apos;ve got Goggins giving a Joker-like performance as a darkly hilarious, mentally disturbed madman, while Grace seems to think he&apos;s still on a sitcom, delivering lines with off-putting snark. On the other end, Stewart and Eisenberg fumble between broad comedy and indie drama with little clarity or success blending the two. Not that it&apos;s devoid of laughs; it manages some humor when it focuses on the identity crisis of a slacker-turned-trained-killer. Unfortunately, our hero wasn&apos;t the only one trying to awkwardly discover himself; so was the movie.

It speaks of love&apos;s enduring allure and the cost of true love with the modern world&apos;s disdain for simplicity and virtue.\n\nAda (Mame Bineta Sane) loves Souleiman (Traore), a construction worker who hasn&apos;t been paid in three months. They are beautiful people worthy of Romeo and Juliet and just as star-crossed. Ada is doomed to marry the rich Omar (Babacar Sylla), a situation envied by almost everyone but Ada, for whom the rich life with a man she doesn&apos;t love holds no allure.\n\nSo far so good because she&apos;ll marry Omar while Souleiman is lost at sea going to Spain, where he hoped for wages. That&apos;s about the most sense in the film because the strange reappearance of Souleiman later in the film will challenge your sense of logic while he appears with others as ghosts, who are probably responsible for the fires set at Ada&apos;s new home.\n\nDirector Mati Diop, with a gift for weaving the real with the magical, takes a leisurely cinematic stroll through the tragedy, keeping the dialogue simple enough to read at the bottom of the screen while the lovers are talking or loving. The images of Muejiza Tower help to emphasize the theme of change and empowerment.\n\nThe investigation of the fires and strange appearances gets mixed leading to slight confusion of identities. Yet, that&apos;s the point: the loss of true love can upend any life, and the confusion of friends and family about a marriage can contribute to the tragedy that may ensue.\n\nMeanwhile multiple, maybe too many, images of the rolling surf and setting sun can crowd the screen with too much imagery and not enough insightful dialogue.

Well, at least, that&apos;s how it looks in movies. We&apos;ve seen Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior lead powerful rebellions against their respective ironfisted governments, Clary Fray battle demons and supernaturals, and Jupiter Jones get crowned as the cosmic queen. I mean, from becoming mere sexual objects for playboy billionaires, they&apos;ve gone as far as being the supreme leader of the universe, what else can these women do just so they could equate themselves with men? What about as an international assassin?\n\nIn Barely Lethal, 16 year-old Megan Walsh (not her real name) is a trained international assassin. This premise already engages interest and holds so much potential, but it fails to deliver a satisfying result. The problem begins when Megan leaves the academy where little girls are trained to become assassins. She fakes her death and enrolls herself in a suburban highschool, hoping everything is going to be normal. Only it turns out it isn&apos;t as easy as it seems. From here, the trajectory of the narrative disappoints immensely. It begins undermining the capacity of its lead character by dismissing the fact that she is a trained killer, exposing her vulnerabilities and teenage dramas, instead. This isn&apos;t a totally a insane idea, she&apos;s 16-year old, after all. But getting further dragged by bland one liners and intertwining subplots, makes it even worse. Eventually, in the wake of its competing concerns, it loses grip of its own direction and struggles to arrive to a decent endpoint. It also doesn&apos;t succeed tapping the utmost otential of its strong supports by not giving them enough material to work with. Jessica Alba and Samuel Jackson barely do something here, though there may be some little moments with their presence, that aren&apos;t really devoid of wit. Almost everything just falls flat, and the comic effort couldn&apos;t provide any aid, either, to redeem its sagging narrative.\n\nBy the time the movie is already fast approaching its finale, it isn&apos;t any more surprise if Megan never came close to any of those heroines mentioned earlier, and it really disappoints that she never really came to be someone interesting, either. Well, you may want to blame that to her unconvincing chemistry (not saying there&apos;s any) with both her love interests, and a boring villain whose presence may have only really felt during the last action sequence of the movie.\n\nBARELY LETHAL wastes almost every promising attribute it has to live up to its overwhelming potential. In the end, it abandons what could be a unique take on the young espionage genre, and sets itself taking the leads of countless others it seems to emulate.

It is a speculative fiction based upon a few facts. Speculation was aroused by the fact that a woman who never married and apparently never had a love affair came to have such a deep and intelligent understanding of relationships. I shan&apos;t expand on how potentially offensive that is. But story line is based on a few simple facts. While he was in the country Jane Austen would have almost certainly met Mr Lefroy; while on a journey to see her sister she had a rather long stop off in London during which time she began writing Pride and Prejudice and there was the mention of some letters.\n\nIt started out so well; the stifling quiet of a country life broken by our future genius at work. The structure of this opening sequence was very effective. I was thinking I&apos;m going to love this film. But there was a niggling in the back of my mind. None of the reviews had been great, but I didn&apos;t know why (I hadn&apos;t actually read any only seen the 2 ½ or 3 stars).\n\nI continued thinking it was wonderful through most of the film. James McAvoy was beautifully intense, Anne Hathaway was solid, Maggie Smith delightfully amusing and Anna Maxwell Martin underused. There were some beautiful scenes, some so intense. For example a scene in a ball when they are both standing back to back apparently to talking other people but having a very deep conversation.\n\nBut then, as with far too many movies we moved through the climax to an ending of this story line and that story line oh and we&apos;d better conclude this one as well and now everything is tied up in a neat little bundle.\n\nThis is a film that would have benefited from an ambivalent ending, because, aside from the fact that we know she ends up the Western World&apos;s highest selling female author the film wasn&apos;t actually about that. The film was about the journey toward it. To have left us hanging when, perhaps, she was leaving Lefroy or back in her stiflingly quiet house would have been much more effective in terms of the story and strengthened the film.

Leo does not pretend to have the answers by a long shot. One of my fav parts of this movie was a discussion Leo has with an environmentalist from India whose calling out the United States for their part in Global Warming. Leo never defends his home country only comes clean about how realistic or unrealistic it is for America to go clean.\n\nThere was this one part of the film where Leo meets with his agricultural guy telling me that America needs to change it&apos;s diet. Pretty much telling me that I need to stop buying things like Doritos, which is a small part of a big picture, and by odd coincidence, I just happen to have a big bag of cool ranch in my lap. Granted, it would not hurt my waist line to give up the nachos, but there are other food products that poor Americans like myself would starve if they suddenly disappeared. Proving that this environmental issue for me anyway is not a black and white issue. \n\nLeo created something that does what a documentary is suppose to do. His agenda was to inform you about the climate change and that&apos;s what he does, and he does it without having to make anyone look evil (well not too evil anyway). it&apos;s all about laying out the facts and seeing what we can do with that info.\n\nMuch respect.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",4.1,PG,"['Documentary', 'News']",2016-10-30,"climate change,environment,ecosystem,solar energy,solar panel",PT1H36M,"[{'name': 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/'}, {'name': 'Ban Ki-moon', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2559634/'}, {'name': 'Alejandro G.

It began with &apos;300&apos; (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300&apos;s success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project, the heart warming Polar Express, with varied success.\n\nBeowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar (a delightfully campy Anthony Hopkins)which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover). Help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf (Ray Winstone), who arrives with an army of 14 men and his right hand man, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). It his his job to slay the monster. However, he must also deal with Grendel&apos;s mother (Angelina Jolie). Beowulf is opposed by Unferth (John Malkovich), and has also been paying close attention to the king&apos;s wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).\n\nPerhaps the most surprising element of the film is its sly, wink and a nod, sense of humor. This can be viewed two ways. The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter. However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.\n\nAs expected, Beowulf is visually stunning. I&apos;d argue it is the one category where this film bests &apos;Polar Express&apos;. The 3-D photography is shockingly good. It is a film I wouldn&apos;t want to imagine in the traditional two dimension format. I strongly advise anyone who is going to see this to view the film in 3-D. Without it, the film would be borderline un enjoyable. The highlight is by far the final battle scene,which just begs you to forget the film&apos;s past misdeeds.

I can really say that i was surprised!\n\nFirstly... great animation and effects! I was shocked that this movie had this level of good frames and animation. It felt as if i was watching a Disney / Pixar grade film. Everything exceeded my expectations to be honest. Don&apos;t listen to what other say about this movie. Feels sad when i can really see and feel that theres been good amount of work put into this move and still some rate it 1 or 3 stars. Like what the hell at least appreciate the load of work put into this somewhat masterpiece! I Really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to those who fished the series of at the last season.\n\nSecondly... The choice of music was super and really felt what the producers wanted us to feel when watching the movie. My eyes 👀 got a little blurry, if you know what i mean . The only thing I didn&apos;t like was how they introduced the new characters! Everything happens fast in the beginning and I struggled to know who is the enemy and what their motive was. They didn&apos;t get enough time and had little to no backstory at all, that made it difficult for me to fully grasp the whole conflict and situation. In the end it was a bit more clear as I progressed through the end but still wasn&apos;t enough i think. That&apos;s why i rate it a 7.5 - 8 stars.\n\nWatch it and I promise you will enjoy it and don&apos;t bother with the low rating, most of them are either haters or really just grumpy party killers / Karen&apos;s who doesn&apos;t care or appreciate others hard work.😎\n\nCan&apos;t wait for the next season.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.7,TV-14,"['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure']",2023-06-16,"based on tv series,based on anime series,based on manga,magic,sword",PT1H50M,"[{'name': 'Bryn Apprill', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6548466/'}, {'name': 'Tia Lynn Ballard', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3631965/'}, {'name': 'Steve Blum', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089707/'}]","[{'name': 'Ayataka Tanemura', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9734896/'}]","[{'name': 'Johnny Onda', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14157504/'}, {'name': 'Ai Orii', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14157503/'}, {'name': 'Yuuki Tabata', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9339591/'}]",4.8,4.3

My love of the French original may have set the bar too high it seems. Also my only major personal gripe is the voice dubbing of David belle. For some reason it struck a nerve with me and I could never really appreciate any scene. If you&apos;re looking for a good way to blow 2 hours or haven&apos;t seen the original by all means go see it but for myself this was just not what I had expected.

It&apos;s main plot addresses the struggle when everyone has the best intentions but not the same values. Additionally, the film makes honest and straightforward comments on controversial issues in today&apos;s society that are often taboo in the media such as mental illness, the hypocrisy of children&apos;s exposure to violence and sex, religion, and the flaws in the American education system. This sounds heavy and uncomfortable but these issues are paralleled in such a way that parts of the film had us in tears; from laughing so hard. Director Matt Ross says the project started as an exaggerated exploration of the difficult choices that must be made in regards to raising children in today&apos;s society. I think the film goes a step further and awakens an internal dialogue in each of it&apos;s viewers about the way that we live our own lives based on societal influences. Furthermore, the performances given by the perfectly arranged cast enhance your investment in the story in a way that will cause you to question what right and wrong really are when you&apos;re only trying to do your best and do what you think is best for those that you love.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}",3.9,R,"['Comedy', 'Drama']",2016-07-29,"funeral,suicide,suicide of mother,reference to noam chomsky,loss of wife",PT1H58M,"[{'name': 'Viggo Mortensen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/'}, {'name': 'George MacKay', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1126657/'}, {'name': 'Samantha Isler', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4705966/'}]","[{'name': 'Matt Ross', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0743671/'}]","[{'name': 'Matt Ross', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0743671/'}]",4.25,4.15

I actually don&apos;t recall another movie that features truck racing (gonna have to put my thinking cap on for this one).\n\nThiago Martins stars as truck racer Roger. His Dad sponsors his racing team, but when his dad dies, they are faced with financial difficulty. To make matters worse, his dad owed money to a lot of companies, and owed a substantial amount to Odilon ((Evandro Mesquita), the film&apos;s antagonist.\n\nUnable to settle the debt, Odilon offers Roger a job as a getaway driver, stealing cargo from other trucks. Roger asks his best friend Danilo (Raphael Logam) to help him. Unfortunately fate intervenes.\n\nI actually really enjoyed the first act and most of the second act. The part where I started losing interest in the film, was where Danilo&apos;s 14-year old daughter Barbara (Vitoria Valentin) became a prominent character. With no family left, she had to stay with Roger. I found the story surrounding Barbara lame and unbelievable, and a very lazy set-up.\n\nOh, don&apos;t worry, it gets worse. During Roger&apos;s final race, this 14-year old girl gives an experienced driver like Roger tips on how to drive!! I don&apos;t know what&apos;s worse; the fact she was telling him what to do, or the fact he actually listened to her!! I&apos;m sorry, that was just preposterous. This character managed to ruin the entire movie.\n\nAnd then there&apos;s Roger&apos;s rival driver Rainha (Sheron Menezzes), whom I didn&apos;t really understand. Was she just another driver, or was she romantically involved with Roger in the past? She was the most incoherent character and her actions didn&apos;t make sense. While there&apos;s no chemistry between them throughout the movie, she suddenly ends up being the romantic interest during the film&apos;s final few minutes. Where did that come from??!\n\n&apos;Overhaul&apos; could have been a great movie with better characters, and a better script. I thought the action sequences were very good.

And Heart in the Right Place.\n\nIn the film, Paula (Loes Luca) and Johan (Gijs de Lange) decide to go to Bonaire to the Pension Casa Coco run by their old friend Pleun (Joke Bruijs). This time they decided to take their other friend Toon (Gerard Cox) with them after his divorce as well. The problem is that Pleun and Toon are ex-lover of each other and they haven&apos;t seen each other for years. This coming together can only add to the awkwardness between the two.\n\nThis film is the third film that Bob Wilbers has directed in the same year. This crowds are still due to the corona pandemic of recent years. Casa Coco would otherwise have been released in cinemas earlier. Despite this delay, this film unfortunately brings little new compared to other Dutch romantic comedies. The film could actually have been put on a streaming service such as Videoland before, because to actually see this film in the cinema now, it is actually not really worth the film. The three writers of the film are also more known for writing standard Dutch romantic comedies and unfortunately have not really created anything special with this new film.\n\nThe story is a bit messy and contains too many different characters. There is almost no real clear story in the film. The film also becomes more filled with the different stories of all the different characters, who are more mindful of their own business. There is talk about a history between some characters, but this is not really clearly portrayed, so this doesn&apos;t really interest you as a viewer. If the film itself had had fewer characters and the remaining characters had been given a clearer background, the film would have come across more clearly with characters that the viewer cares about a bit more. Aside from the messy story, this remains on the predictable side. As a viewer you can roughly expect where the story is going and what is going to happen. This way you can keep ahead of the story, which only makes for a long-winded feeling.\n\nThanks to the standard story and the amount of characters, most of the film cast also have few opportunities to do anything special with their roles. The various characters remain each other, but overshadow with their own storylines. The chemistry between the many couples does not come across as really romantic and sometimes even feels a bit more forced. It would also have helped here if the film cast had consisted of fewer people, because then actors such as Gerard Cox or Joke Bruijs might have had some opportunities to make something special out of their roles.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.75,0,['Comedy'],2022-11-10,0,PT1H28M,"[{'name': 'Gerard Cox', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185039/'}, {'name': 'Joke Bruijs', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115840/'}, {'name': 'Gijs de Lange', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0486122/'}]","[{'name': 'Bob Wilbers', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1023549/'}]","[{'name': 'Maria Goos', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329645/'}, {'name': 'Peter Römer', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753955/'}, {'name': 'Jacqueline Epskamp', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258414/'}]",2.35,1.25

A lynch pin holding much together, he was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most -Renee is good in her role, strong, fair, engaging, and dare I say just a great character that acts not just as a goal, but an engaging character mode. She&apos;s got sass, vulnerability, and yet compassion that makes for a strong character.\n\n-Ben Wang is more of the comedic relief, but not in the stumbling boob, gigantic joke that these roles can take on. He&apos;s again realistic, fun, great timing, but also holds more past the jokes in his goal to make this quest for identity better.\n\n-As for Li, he&apos;s got the most extremes of character, which is kind of the point, but outside of trying to be overly cool, it works with the symphony of feelings that play out in this journey.\n\n-There is hurt, questions being asked, but also recognition and heart, and to do that in such a young age, again for Disney in the modern era, tough to achieve, but he did it.\n\n-And the chemistry works very well, a believable relationship built between these people that throws so much story in it instead of the political topics being the center.\n\nPacing -The movie may not be the most exciting at times, as expected of a coming of age tale, but it does work and still move to be engaging.\n\n-Chang&apos;s journey has the fun moments, the no so fun moments, and the balanced moments that all work themselves into an order that remained intriguing to me.\n\n-And throw in the entertainment values in this movie, even the slower parts had good time awareness and seemed catered to telling this tale and never losing just having fun.\n\nThe Process and Journey -When it comes to a character working towards a goal... you know it&apos;s all about the journey to get there and not just the end game.\n\n-And this movie does a fantastic job of bring you into that process, in my opinion.\n\n-We&apos;ve got montages of training that of course are cliché and expected of this movie, but with the music, the editing with the sound/commentary, and breaking it up moments... it feels fresh and fun.\n\n-Throw in the fact that there is a documentary/video making approach to the film, and it adds this modern relativity to it that dare I say makes it better in my opinion.\n\n-And again, it has these nuances that multigenerational approaches can enjoy and respect, but never loses the fun moment, even when things take a slower journey -That&apos;s right, even the back half of the film where things change has a process that is respectable, and kind of shows a more realistic approach to character development than what Disney often does.\n\n-That again helps tie the movie down to the grounded moment and keep focus, and makes these harder moments believable, engaging, and quite honestly more impactful.\n\n-That is a beautiful thing to keep me entertained during slower moments.\n\n-The Humor -Chang&apos;s dunking journey may have some in your face moments that are cringe worthy, but a lot of it just feels very natural and fun.\n\n-Klutzes like me, will enjoy the slapstick stumbling as he works on getting in shape, appreciating the falls with a purpose vs. Falls for being dumb.\n\n-The one-liners and stings are timed well, and pulled in at the right times, alongside the awkward banter that arises with the use of this stuff.\n\n-And the fact that it gives you time to reset and enjoy the variety is smart, allowing the humor to be a topping, not the whole movie, which is very impressive in my opinion.\n\nThe Overall Morals Of The Story -The movie is of course a Disney coming of age tale, and that means we probably need to learn something.\n\n-And this movie accomplishes much of this with lessons that actually are logical, balanced, and not so extreme like so many of their projects are.\n\n-It helps with identity searching without so much entitlement and empowerment to the point of toxic movements.\n\n-It conveys realistic growth and just how fallible we are, but doesn&apos;t paint anyone a major enemy to do it, but rather shows how the character struggles.\n\n-And it teaches so much about the hard work that comes when things hit the fan. It&apos;s beautiful the way it works out and really shows how a story can be developed and be amazing.\n\nThe Music -It&apos;s a powerful track list that brings so much with it in regards to the utility and feelings that a good song can bring.\n\n-Knowing most of the songs, the nostalgic factor is of course fun and inspiring to have a blast to your own achievements and memories.\n\n-And yet, the selection again works well to go with the feeling of the scene and really deliver the punch that would be gone without it. Such a great use of music.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nA Tad Hokey at Times -This is hard to achieve, but the movie does dive a bit into the preachy hokey moments that make families go AWWWWWW.\n\n-They are few and far between, and often avoid getting too monologue like, and I like that it&apos;s not too in your face.\n\n-When you do that, it works so well that even the veering into the lanes don&apos;t throw me off too much to be too upset.\n\nSome Character Development That Needed Some Time -Some things get a little short sighted, and some moments could have had more heat, time, and a scene or two to integrate.\n\n-Yet again, most of the characters and areas they had to approach, were again stellar in their handling and even these missing moments were not quite as missed in the grand scheme because of the stronger moments.\n\n-The finish might have needed just a little more time for the full kick for me, but again, I&apos;m being nitpicky on this particular area.\n\nA Tad Longer Than Probably Needed with The Content -Given the direction they took, it felt a tad long at times, a few moments maybe a bit more dragged out to get cameos in or throw that one moment into the mix.\n\n-But again, I can&apos;t say there was a lot of dead time either, and so reducing by like 10-15 minutes might have put this at the right time, unless they had made more time with the other characters.\n\nPredictable For The Most Part -I mean, this was not one of those unique stories that revolutionizes the movie world, so as such, the twist factor is pretty minimal.\n\n-And even though I know where this is going and can see where things are going to fall, it still has enough entertainment and class with it, that the predictability is not the full run over that other movies do.\n\n-Therefore, again, this movie may not be the most original, mind blowing, or dare I say top notch sports movie, but that heart helps things out.\n\nThe VERDICT: To my surprise, this Disney original film really works for me and feels like the time back in the 90s and 2000s when Disney knew how to have fun, tell stories, and make entertaining stories. Chang Can Dunk shows how to take real life issues, but wrap them in engaging, natural and fun stories that help break away from the drudges of reality. I loved the movements of earnest focus, and the way the acting/characters blend well to teach the lessons and not make me hate what I&apos;m learning. It drops so much of the entitlement and superiority and instead focuses on just being real and constructive. I loved the jokes, I loved the montages, and again the music has such power behind the familiar strands. Sure the movie is not perfect in all its endeavors. It&apos;s not the most unique tale, and it does not match things and characters perfectly, but I also don&apos;t think it veered too far.

And Don Knotts was fabulous - we need to find more work for Don Knotts, he&apos;s so good! I also loved the Adam West cameo at the end.\n\nThe problem with the film was, as pointed out by a few, that the story was thin and they filled the empty spaces with fun moments, like the Spice Girls karaoke scene which cracked me up. More attention should have been made towards a linear plot - but hey, the film wasn&apos;t that long, and the fun scenes they used as mortar really did hold it together.\n\nAll in all, an amusing film, above average in terms of entertainment, but hardly a classic.

Poor Execution.', 'reviewBody': 'The general messages conveyed are powerful, and there&apos;s no denying that we urgently need to regulate a technology that has encroached into every facet of our lives - it&apos;s like letting people drive without introducing any traffic laws.\n\nThe execution of this documentary, however, is very underwhelming, to say the least. There are the usuals: catchy montages, TED-style interviews, news soundbites, and the most annoying of all - artificially created (pun intended) graphics of AI scanning data in a stereotypical digital font paired with silly sound effects which, unless the primary audience of this documentary is fifth graders, I don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s necessary to incessantly rehash them. And then there&apos;s the unimaginative &apos;robotic voice.&apos; It&apos;s just puerile.\n\nMaybe the producers are wary that people still won&apos;t get the danger of unregulated AI without these gimmicks. But I&apos;d argue that people would be more alarmed to learn how AI has been infiltrating and affecting our lives in the least expected ways. If the documentary can clearly point out the potential harms as a consequence, I think people will naturally find the lack of regulation disturbing, no silly visuals and sound effects are needed. Sometimes I think they actually undermine the severity of potential danger at hand. For example, the scene where a teenager is mistakenly stopped by plainclothes police, instead of being accompanied with yet another piece of cheesy soundtrack meant to suggest danger, it would be so much more powerful if everything is just eerily silent.\n\nAnd the interviews and info - yes, AI is like a black box even to the programmers, but can you explain it in layman&apos;s terms so that people get it? - could be a lot more insightful. Even some short Vox-style Youtube clips have explored these issues in greater depth.\n\nThe themes explored are a bit all over the place too. I get it this domain is relatively new, so the vocabulary and focus aren&apos;t that streamlined yet, still... Sometimes the documentary brings up issues of obvious biases, which is consistent with the title, but sometimes we don&apos;t even know what the problem is, it&apos;s simply an issue of things being completely nontransparent and/or unverified by a third party.

With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.\n\nBearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky&apos;s recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality – humanity on the razor&apos;s edge of animal brutality – is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.\n\nRightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he&apos;s decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.\n\nPlaying on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you&apos;ll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.\n\nIn truth, Drive isn&apos;t pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.\n\nHer fragile character&apos;s relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They&apos;re not family, they&apos;re not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it&apos;s utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV&apos;s Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling&apos;s character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film&apos;s end.\n\nDrive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.\n\nNicolas Winding Refn&apos;s Drive is an anomaly. It&apos;s like a 1200 horsepower hybrid.

In EL CONDE (The Count), Larrain makes Pinochet a literal monster: A vampire who, even after death, is still sucking the soul out of the Chilean people.\n\nLarrain, working with frequent screenplay collaborator Guillermo Calderon, has fashioned a true horror film. Gory and full of grotesque scenes, but, at it&apos;s core, it&apos;s a pitch black satire. It&apos;s not the first time that Larrain has taken such a fanciful tack with a &apos;bio-pic&apos;, his fabulous 2016 NERUDA turned the life of the namesake poet into a Film Noir thriller. EL CONDE is narrated in English and compactly traces Pinochet from his youth 250 years prior in France to his reign in Chile from 1973 to 1990 (Pinochet actually did have family roots tracing back to France). The bulk of the story takes place in the years after his official death (2006). Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is living in a decaying old mansion with his long-time right hand man and butler, Fyodor (Alfredo Castro) and his less than loving wife Lucia (Gloria Munchmeyer). Pinochet&apos;s brood of ingrate children have gathered to divy up the family fortune which, in true dictator style, was largely stolen. An accountant, Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger), has been summoned to oversee the financial skulduggery. Carmencita is a nun and she functions as the &apos;Van Helsing&apos; of the piece. She&apos;s also doubles as an Exorcist of sorts.\n\nThe movie is shot exquisitely in Black & White by the great Ed Lachman (CAROL, VIRGIN SUICIDES). Lachman&apos;s work truly ascends when the Count takes flight sweeping over the landscape like a dark overlord. A later, first flight of a vampire, is one of the most soaring sights in a film this year. The sound work here is exceptional with a surround sound symphony of creaking floors and rotting detritus. The classically based music score adds to the gloom and doom. Visually, Larrain and Lachman make references to films such as Carl Dreyer&apos;s JEANNE D&apos;ARC (Actress Luchsinger bears a striking resemblance to Falconetti) and VAMPYR. This count isn&apos;t content to just drink the blood of his victims - he consumes their very hearts as well.\n\nThe theme of vampirism is an obvious metaphor, but Larrain handles it well, with delicious dark touches. Still, he can&apos;t help but let things get a bit too fanciful and drags in everything from Marie Antoinette to the Falklands war to a surprise cameo. It muddies things up a bit and extends the allegory a bit too thin, even as it strikes a strong blow about the permanence of evil.\n\nEL CONDE is a stirring movie, that doesn&apos;t fully hit its marks, but it does so with masterly style and intellectual vigor.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': None, 'bestRating': None, 'ratingValue': None}}",3.25,R,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'History']",2023-09-15,"male frontal nudity,male full frontal nudity,satire comedy,satirical comedy,violence",PT1H50M,"[{'name': 'Jaime Vadell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0882994/'}, {'name': 'Gloria Münchmeyer', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618416/'}, {'name': 'Alfredo Castro', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0998846/'}]","[{'name': 'Pablo Larraín', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883257/'}]","[{'name': 'Guillermo Calderón', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5979724/'}, {'name': 'Pablo Larraín', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883257/'}]",3.25,4.1

But, I REALLY do like a nice Classic Period Gothic Chiller (HAMMER anyone...?) and coincidentally I frigg&apos;n LOVE Horror films about Asylums, so I was very much looking forward to seeing this.\n\nI will say this though: &apos;Thank GOD that it was absolutely NOTHING like &apos;THE CALL&apos;, which in my lowly and wretched opinion, was just about THE most hideous piece of steaming $hit I have ever seen. I remember painfully TRYING to watch that, thinking, &apos;THIS is the guy who did &apos;SESSION 9&apos; and &apos;TRANSSIBERIA&apos;...???\n\nClearly, MOST of the time the director is indeed very talented and knows what he is doing (perhaps &apos;THE CALL&apos; was the result of studio meddling) In this film, the acting was excellent all around. The story kept one&apos;s interest, especially when fairly early on you begin to realize that everything is not exactly as it seems. There really is nothing at all &apos;Wrong&apos; with the film in any way, but probably just for me personally, I would have liked the story to be a bit more intense and the plot points and/or twists to have a little more &apos;Oomph&apos; behind them. I guess I just found the story, although good and entertaining, to be somewhat on the laid-back and light side. I think that if the director could have possibly infused a bit more of an undercurrent of intensity and palpable &apos;Mood&apos; (like in &apos;SESSION 9&apos;) I feel that that would have added a lot more to the film.\n\nBut, with that said, the movie is very competently done and it is engaging and all of the characters are interesting. I just REALLY would have liked the &apos;twists&apos; and atmosphere to pack more of a punch. I was kind of generous giving it a &apos;7&apos;, but going by what I feel objectively the general appeal of the film would be to others, rather than just my personal, snotty preference, that seems about right.\n\nSo, I would say that if the look and premise of this film appeals to you, you should find it pretty entertaining.

Jon Karthaus also plays a character in this film.\n\nIn the film, family members go with their partners and demented father to the French Burgundy, where they used to go as a family. This time they gather here for a memorial weekend and will scatter the ashes of their deceased brother and friend here.\n\nWhen Evelien (Lisa Zweerman) arrives too late with her new love Bram (Kay Greidanus), an uneasy atmosphere suddenly arises between everyone. Despite this atmosphere, as family and friends they just try to continue their traditions for one last time. This time everything is just different than they were used to.\n\nWith this movie, Jon Karthaus and the rest of the movie cast and crew seem to have come up with the idea for this movie together. In addition to Jon Karthaus, others from the film cast also co-wrote the story of the final film. For some of them this is only their first writing. For others who have written something before in the front of a film, this writing also remains a bit on the starting side. The fact that a story has been written with four people, some of whom are still on the inexperienced side, can be seen in the film itself. Many things like the characters or events are not given a clear background or further explanation. For example, you hardly know what everyone&apos;s relationship is, or what the rules are for the different games they play together. For example, it sometimes seems as if you are looking at holiday images of strange people that you do not know yourself.\n\nThis film is also reminiscent of a comedy made by actor Adam Sandler. With his Grown Ups films, for example, he would take befriended actors to a beautiful place to have the film played here, but otherwise he made little effort to really make something beautiful or comical of these films. Just like in such films of his, the most laughed is also by the film cast themselves in this film. The comedy of the film is much on the predictable or forced side, so there is not really much to laugh about anymore. The story itself is also a bit odd and sloppy. Characters often make separate decisions at the wrong moments, so that as a viewer, despite the fact that the film is a comedy, it is sometimes difficult to take it seriously. Many of these strange decisions seem unrealistic.\n\nDue to the lack of explanation and the separate actions that the characters sometimes undergo, the acting does not come out so strongly. Only when you learn about the relationships between the different characters later in the film can you better understand why they react to certain things the way they do. On the other hand, it does create extra discomfort between the characters and for you as a viewer.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.7,0,['Comedy'],2023-01-19,"female topless nudity,outdoor nudity,public nudity,friendship,death of a friend",PT1H29M,"[{'name': 'Ludwig Bindervoet', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2807735/'}, {'name': 'Sarah Chronis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2457706/'}, {'name': 'Steef de Bot', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6024583/'}]","[{'name': 'Jon Karthaus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670246/'}]","[{'name': 'Kay Greidanus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340028/'}, {'name': 'Jon Karthaus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670246/'}, {'name': 'Lisa Zweerman', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4313760/'}]",2.05,0.5

Second sequels or third instalments of a franchise don&apos;t always fare well, especially in horror and comedy, &apos;Final Destination 3&apos; is one of the better examples in a genre where sequels have a patchy history. The novelty has not yet worn off and in a way is more refined.\n\nSure, the story is more of the same and formulaic. Meanwhile, there is too much dull downtime between deaths where dialogue and exposition can be clumsy at times.\n\nThe special effects are not always brilliant and the characters are as shallow as ever.\n\nHowever, &apos;Final Destination 3&apos; is as atmospheric and stylish as its previous two films. The music has a haunting eeriness and James Wong does a more than competent job in the director&apos;s chair, showing a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula and not losing what made his direction work in the first film.\n\nLike the second, although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative (faring even better in this regard actually). The tanning bed and nail gun deaths were particularly good and two of the best and most imaginative of the series. The script has some wonderful humour that is black and ironic and has just as much tension and a sense of dread. The amusement park/roller-coaster scene is not as good as the opening scenes in the previous films, especially visually, but it&apos;s still very scary. The photo record is surprising and there is an intricacy in places.\n\n&apos;Final Destination 3&apos; has the best ending perhaps of the series, to me it&apos;s the least contrived and more logical than the one in particularly the second film. In the acting stakes, it fares favourably too. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good.\n\nOverall, a good deadly ride that&apos;s worth getting on board for, as long as one knows what to expect. 7/10 Bethany Cox', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",2.9,R,"['Horror', 'Thriller']",2006-02-10,"tanning bed,characters murdered one by one,supernatural horror,reference to spongebob squarepants,premonition",PT1H33M,"[{'name': 'Mary Elizabeth Winstead', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935541/'}, {'name': 'Ryan Merriman', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581365/'}, {'name': 'Kris Lemche', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0501210/'}]","[{'name': 'James Wong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939128/'}]","[{'name': 'Glen Morgan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604688/'}, {'name': 'James Wong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939128/'}, {'name': 'Jeffrey Reddick', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714695/'}]",2.85,2.2

The subject matter deserves it.', 'reviewBody': 'Freak Show has easily been my most eagerly awaited movie of the past year and when it was finally released I waisted no time in seeing it however I was left deflated and in need of something more, ultimately the story being told is important and deserved a better script, with more fleshed out characters, potrayls, more feeling, emotion, warmth and it was good for what it was but it could have really been special if they had of tried more.\n\nI&apos;m new to the boundfully talented Alex Lawther and I have quickly signed myself up as a fan of his so when I realised that he was the lead in this movie I was thrilled and when you throw in Bette Midler who has been attached to this project since they beginning then I settled myself in for what I expected to be quite the treat of a movie.\n\nEarly on in the movie I found myself mesmerized by Lawther, he captivates you with his genuine, awkward, honest and charming potrayal of Billy Bloom. His refreshing and quiet brilliant style of acting with his subtle yet on the money mannerisms, movements and playfulness with the dialogue is wonderful however it&apos;s just a shame that all this talent was for the most part waisted on what could have been something really special.\n\nGoing in to this movie I wasn&apos;t sure what message I was going to get at the end but expected for the movie to be more multi layered than what was offered. I was expecting a world wind of emotion, anger and frustration due to story being told at the heart of the movie being unfairly and frustratingly as real in today&apos;s society as it has for generations, they issue and story deserves better and more than a one-dimentional, phone it in movie that overall for me felt like an educational movie that would be played in schools. Were was the backstory and multi-layered characters...why should I believe in and releate to Billy Bloom or get angry or a better understanding of the beliefs of Abigail Breslins character? The characters were flat and stereotypical with no depth. I wanted warmth and emotion from Billy Bloom as he fought to be who he wanted to be...i wanted anger and frustration...tears and fight when he was told he couldn&apos;t be who he wanted to be and I have no doubt that given the right material Alex Lawther could have truly shined in this role. \n\nBette Midler as Muv was really Bette Midler being the usual Bette Midler, her character was a mess and not fully explained and appeared to be a after thought when it came to meaning and point but the same can be said for the rest of the supporting cast who looked to be phoning it in and bored throughout.\n\nLawther is fabulous but at times can overly theatrical in a way that distracted me from what was happening in a scene, i wanted less costume changes and more storytelling...ok he is flamboyant gay but we didn&apos;t need 8-9 costume changes to make that point...less is more and I think the movie relied to much on the visual than the dialogue and meaning of why this story and issue needed to be told.\n\nIn the end I wanted less FREAK SHOW and more just good old storytelling...the subject matter deserved a lot more.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",3.25,Not Rated,"['Comedy', 'Drama']",2018-01-12,"high school,queer,transvestite,bullying,teenage boy",PT1H31M,"[{'name': 'Alex Lawther', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3867299/'}, {'name': 'Ian Nelson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4122775/'}, {'name': 'AnnaSophia Robb', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1455681/'}]","[{'name': 'Trudie Styler', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836548/'}]","[{'name': 'Patrick J.

The craftsmanship in story, direction, writing, editing, camerawork, etc. is most certainly evident - spot on - with the presentation&apos;s only weakness in the story element of a soccer coach dealing with an angry stage-father who thinks his son the be-all/end-all of youth players.

Alphonse loses his body and has his soul transferred to a suit of armor while Edward loses his leg and arm. A few years later, Edward becomes a State Alchemist working for the government to find him and Alphonse find the Philosopher&apos;s Stone, an artifact that would help them regain their bodies while performing human transmutation without a circle while discovering the truths about their world governed by the law of Equivalent Exchange, the stone itself, alchemy, their family, and evil forces using alchemy for sinister purposes. That anime was Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nWhen I watched the 2003 anime and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood with my brother, I was surprised at how beautifully written the story was and how compelling the characters and their motivations where. Their situations make you relate to them during their adventures, but not only that. It deals with deeper themes including the true meaning of family, and the difference between life and death. Nonetheless, I loved both of those shows and are now my favorites of all time. So, when a live-action film adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist was being made, I was really excited, hoping it wouldn&apos;t end being like Death Note (a USA live-action adaptation back in 2017 which disrespected the source material fans loved). Then, when it arrived on Netflix, my brother and I watched it... And sadly, it ended up being a disappointment. It&apos;s not as poor or terrible as Death Note, Dragonball Evolution, and The Last Airbender, but it lacked something that made both the manga and anime much more complex.\n\n Let&apos;s start with the problems. Those who read the manga and watched the anime might be disappointed. I&apos;m not going to spoil the story, but I will say this... the movie didn&apos;t include key characters that contributed to the story including Scar, Armstrong, Izumi, and Fuhrer Bradley. If the producers of the film ever make a sequel, they better bring them together. Not to mention the special effects on the Mannequin soldiers are really poor along with the other effects including the Homunculus. Also, the story fell apart. It had a decent start with an accurate depiction of the younger Edward and Alphonse using alchemy to try and bring their mother back, but the rest of the film suffers from some of the biggest problems. The writing is really weak because it had bits of the manga and place them out of order in a two hour and fourteen minute length, which results in uneven pacing that drags too long and because of that, the character development ends up lacking in comparison.\n\nThat being said, there are some good things that saved the film. The actors did a fine job capturing the personalities of Edward, Alphonse, Winry, Colonel Mustang, and the bad guys Lust, Gluttony, and Envy. The other actors who portrayed General Hakuro, Shou Tucker, and Hughes also did a fine job. The directing is actually really good. It captures the look and feel of the anime perfectly. Also, the music score is good. It&apos;s atmospheric, it has a great use of drama and action, and ends up being really powerful. And most importantly, some of the effects, including the transmutation sequences and Alphonse&apos;s metal armor, is nicely detailed and looks good in movie form. Oh, and the costumes are great and are accurate to the anime/manga counterparts. Kudos to the producers for being at least some effort.\n\nOverall, Fullmetal Alchemist ends up being a huge disappointment. It has good intentions and is faithful to the anime/manga, but due to the weak writing and lack of character development, the movie just comes up short. My advice, if you want to see a live-action movie based on your favorite manga/anime, this film is only watchable. However, you might want to revisit the 2003 anime and Brotherhood again and remember the complexity they had. 2.5/5', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 5}}",2.65,TV-14,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']",2018-02-19,"transmutation,live action remake of anime,suit of armour,scene after end credits,based on manga",PT2H15M,"[{'name': 'Ryôsuke Yamada', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2425074/'}, {'name': 'Tsubasa Honda', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4836118/'}, {'name': 'Dean Fujioka', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2601626/'}]","[{'name': 'Fumihiko Sori', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1216495/'}]","[{'name': 'Hiromu Arakawa', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2086079/'}, {'name': 'Fumihiko Sori', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1216495/'}, {'name': 'Takeshi Miyamoto', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3620555/'}]",0.0,0.0

However, they&apos;re not bad, either. The tension is there, Gal Gadot&apos;s character never gets a free pass and has to struggle to win, and they all further the plot. So while the action scenes aren&apos;t exactly groundbreaking, they&apos;re also well constructed and well executed.\n\nIn terms of acting, this is probably the best dramatic performance Gal Gadot has ever given. While she&apos;s always been a better action actress than a dramatic one and probably always will be, I wouldn&apos;t be too surprised if this ends up being remembered as one of her better performances overall.\n\nAll in all, Heart of Stone is a good movie.

It&apos;s a lot of fun, exciting, has a good amount of energy, has the right amount of horror to not put the kids off it and just makes you smile. So I was glad to see that the love for it gave birth to a long awaited sequel.\n\nWith the excitement comes the caution as sequels from 80&apos;s or 90&apos;s originals have a low success rate. But like with something like &apos;Top Gun: Maverick&apos; I knew that in the right hands if they committed to the concept rather than try and make it contemporary to keep the interest of modern audiences, then this could be as fun as the original.\n\nThere is a promising start that will certainly engage the fans of the original and while the structure as a whole is very familiar, it still never felt like cash grab. There was enough to keep the story going while paying homage to its predecessor which is fine as that is the reason why this film finally exists.\n\nThe action isn&apos;t really as physical as before. But as a few of our stars are a bit seasoned now, some of the changes that they made to accommodate that never made the film drag for me.\n\nThe finale is certainly the film&apos;s high point as there is one moment that will get the fans emotional. It certainly caught me off guard. It left me very satisfied, and I think it will get a strong positive response with other loyal members of the fandom also.\n\nSeeing the trio of Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker was just great. They have not lost their touch or chemistry and Midler in particular can still put on a great show. It never felt they were phoning it in. It felt like they wanted to give something back to the fans which was wholly satisfying. It was also great seeing Doug Jones return. Jones is someone that does not get enough credit from people outside of the industry. You probably don&apos;t realise how much work Jones has done and his signature physical acting was put to good use once again.\n\nAs for the new cast, they weren&apos;t as instantly likable as the ones from the original. But they did a perfectly functional job to help the story move along and were thankfully never annoying.\n\nIt was great seeing parts of the original locations used and bringing back John Debney for that memorable score to be put to use once again. Some parts did look a bit too polished, too much like a set and never felt as dirty or authentic as its predecessor. The pacing is solid but could have been a bit more rampant to give it some adrenaline. The slightly longer running time doesn&apos;t help.\n\nOther minor negatives to speak of was that the stakes never felt that big or consequential. I&apos;m not totally surprised at this as Disney don&apos;t try to make things too scary or risky these days.\n\nBut that being said, the fun factor and energy is still there and despite its flaws I had a blast watching this. As a fan, it was great to see the gang bang together. While some of the nods, call backs and gags didn&apos;t all work, they largely were well executed. For non-fans, I feel this will remain a pleasurable watch. It does a good job celebrating its legacy and never tarnishing it. The emotional and highly satisfying finale proved that they were basically saying thank you to the fans for celebrating the original for so long.\n\nI really hope I&apos;m not the minority as I try to avoid seeing beloved projects through tinted eyes. But I think as a film it&apos;s perfectly fine with some nice moments that anyone can be invested in. But this will clearly satisfy the fans.\n\nI must mention that there is a post credits scene. It&apos;s hard to not give a hint without spoiling it. So that&apos;s all say about it.

Justice. Forgiveness. Freedom.', 'reviewBody': 'Agatha gets invited to join her sister Olivia&apos;s yacht party along with several other elite people. Agatha is a crime enthusiast and runs her own podcast. On the yacht, Olivia reveals the one of her guest won&apos;t make it back to the shore and that they will have contemplate their lives up until then as that boat ride could be their last. As they are woken up to a thud leading to a dead Olivia in the high seas, it is upto Agatha to solve the mystery and catch the culprit. How she does that forms rest of the story.\n\nThe film gets derailed once the on screen death happens and it barely gives enough to buy into the mystery. Since the whole reveal was about delivering the what the flower stood for, let me try to put forth my analogy in those terms..\n\n1. Love = The makers feel the bunch of characters they have are enough to pull off this story. But there is literal lack of bonding between then especially Agatha and Olivia, who are sisters while there is a mention of loss of a loved one that got them distant but, the death of Olivia barely gets any emotion out of Agatha who at best is an amateur crime enthusiast solving the mystery in an hackneyed manner. There is enough love for the genre but nothing transcends onto the screen.\n\n2. Justice = The whole reveal has this as a major aim i.e. Get justice to the deserving. Sadly, the writing denies it as the reveal itself is far from convicinving and the way it is narrated, just complicates it further when seen from a broad perspective, the crime was pretty much over simplified as it is and so were the main suspects.\n\n3. Forgiveness = It is a bit hard to but as an audience, will have to forgive the makers for a bland product. For all the talk about able to forgive and move on, among the characters, it comes way too late and hardly has any impact.\n\n4. Freedom = the film ended and the instant feeling I got was, well Freedom. Not that I kept comparing it with the recent murder mystery films including the Knives Out, but the weak writing made this a tiresome experience, enough to feel free once the film ended. Also, there was no need to show the police as so dummies, glad they were free to from this case in the end.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.55,TV-14,"['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",2023-10-06,"murder,sister,husband wife relationship,dark comedy,revenge",PT1H32M,"[{'name': 'Maribel Verdú', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893941/'}, {'name': 'Stephanie Cayo', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147310/'}, {'name': 'Regina Blandón', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1566368/'}]","[{'name': 'J.M Cravioto', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1458283/'}]","[{'name': 'Javier Durán Pérez', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14069137/'}, {'name': 'Anton Goenechea', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6918567/'}, {'name': 'Carmen Posadas', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692604/'}]",4.55,5.0

The movie tried too hard to be different when they already had a great idea with a fantastic actress that would have worked if they hadn&apos;t tried too hard to be unique. \n\nThe supporting parts were well done, particularly Christopher Walken, and I connected much more with his and Abbie&apos;s relationship in the movie than I did with Abbie and Sam&apos;s. \n\nA final nitpick was that they made the strange decision not to have Abbie appear physically sick at all. Her appearance barely changes throughout and it just makes no sense and once again loses an opportunity for us to connect. \n\nSome great acting overall but it gets dragged down by a bad performance from Michael Huisman and poor writing.

Comparing &apos;The Nice Guys&apos; to &apos;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&apos;, this film easily beats &apos;The Nice Guys&apos; out in my book where I simply found this far more entertaining than it.\n\nA very comedic and compelling film for your viewing pleasure.

Should a film be seen only in terms of the movies that have come before it? \n\nFrom it&apos;s title and poster to the actual film itself, Kodachrome sets itself up to be THAT kind of a road trip movie. The kind that features Hollywood jaw lines gazing into the setting sun as your quintessential bright red convertible speeds through a quiet countryside. This is accompanied with that melodious Indie track that rounds out the scene. Kodachrome is most definitely about something; it has meaning, it has purpose. The performances are affecting. The direction is largely unobtrusive and contents itself with letting the script do all the talking, exuding a tenderness that pervades and persists throughout the entire film. \n\nYet, all of these accomplishments are left denied by the aforementioned screenplay which not only resorts to a fundamental premise that is unoriginal but dialogue that routinely divulges into the perceived cliches of the &apos;road trip&apos; movie. Characters repeatedly break into melancholy monologues about love, life and art, making biting observations on the human condition. From afar, the plot unfurls predictably and there is nary a moment where the viewer is surprised. Also, as a movie where the narrative is driven by the praise for tradition film format and analog technology, and despite having been aptly shot in 35mm film, photography as an art form itself does not play a more central role in dictating the nature of the storytelling. Given it&apos;s narrative simplicity, the experience could have been unique if the origins and vitality of preserving the old art form were entwined into the story, serving as an effective case for the preservation of the film format. \n\nWhile these are my qualms with the movie, there is no denying that it is constructed with care and an eye for detail that could easily have been left out. The characters are fairly well realized through whom the movie commendably balances the humour with the drama. The performances manage to convey the gravity of the story and the simple confidence with which the movie progresses is sure to engage most viewers. Ultimately, Kodachrome stands as an undemanding, welcoming road trip movie; you won&apos;t feel new feelings, but you will revisit old ones, much the same way you might look at some personal Kodak photograph of old.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",3.4,TV-MA,['Drama'],2018-04-20,"trademark in title,one word title,shot on kodak film,kodak,getting fired",PT1H45M,"[{'name': 'Ed Harris', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000438/'}, {'name': 'Jason Sudeikis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837177/'}, {'name': 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0647634/'}]","[{'name': 'Mark Raso', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1764816/'}]","[{'name': 'Jonathan Tropper', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2267086/'}]",3.6,3.6

In Leonard&apos;s hands that still made for a wildly entertaining read, but on the screen it feels a bit on the shallow side. This translation is missing the charm and finesse of its source material, too, and a little of that spice can really go a long way. John Hawkes manages a really convincing, greasy De Niro impression as the soft-hearted enforcer Louis, while Mos Def&apos;s take on mastermind Ordell Robbie (originally played by Samuel L. Jackson) is less indebted to his predecessor. Jennifer Aniston is good as the repressed trophy wife / tennis mom / kidnappee, but the rest of the cast just seems like they&apos;re wearing costumes and playing games. They take themselves lightly, so it&apos;s tough for me to see the situation as all that serious. It&apos;s fine, superficial at worst, but there&apos;s little wonder why it slipped under the radar without a whimper when it hit the screens a couple of years ago.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",2.9,R,"['Comedy', 'Crime']",2014-08-29,"cheating husband,kidnapping,mistress,home invasion,abduction",PT1H38M,"[{'name': 'Jennifer Aniston', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098/'}, {'name': 'Yasiin Bey', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080049/'}, {'name': 'Isla Fisher', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279545/'}]","[{'name': 'Daniel Schechter', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1633080/'}]","[{'name': 'Daniel Schechter', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1633080/'}, {'name': 'Elmore Leonard', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001465/'}]",1.85,3.4

Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.\n\nHere&apos;s a brief re-cap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency, almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the &apos;Union&apos; and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South, the film&apos;s story begins with President Lincoln&apos;s Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen, Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party, Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis: save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.\n\nRunning at 150 minutes, this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates; but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive, Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel Day-Lewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with war-stressed fatigue and a shrill voice, but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation, as a father who has lost a son, and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase &apos;Behind every great man is a woman&apos;. Field&apos;s Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children, not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film, you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn, besides a multitude of top actors.\n\nThis is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making, Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough; the commonality being crucial moments in history, rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nit-pick, I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said &apos;yes&apos; to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnet—it is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.65,PG-13,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']",2012-11-16,"based on real person,american politics,bearded man,1860s,american civil war",PT2H30M,"[{'name': 'Daniel Day-Lewis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000358/'}, {'name': 'Sally Field', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000398/'}, {'name': 'David Strathairn', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000657/'}]","[{'name': 'Steven Spielberg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/'}]","[{'name': 'Tony Kushner', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1065785/'}, {'name': 'Doris Kearns Goodwin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329447/'}]",4.05,4.45

Their family relations are warmed thanks to Arini and Ican starts to like her.","{'author': 'FinnTalks', 'dateCreated': '2021-03-18', 'inLanguage': 'English', 'heading': 'Love Inc. Version: 1.0.2', 'reviewBody': 'In Love for Sale (2018), Andibachtiar Yusuf offers an intriguing &apos;companion-for-hire&apos; premise and introduces us to Arini (Della Dartyan), the enigmatically enchanting, mysterious yet iconic character. Love for Sale&apos;s screenplay is written by Yusuf and Ramly. It tells about a lonely mature single man named Richard (Gading Marten) who attempts to overcome his desperate love life by hiring some woman of a dating app called Love Inc. whom he begins to slowly fall for later on. The storyline flows in between sorrow and melancholy; and yet the love-struck chemistry between the leads brings out an emotional engaging romantic drama. The plot pace moves absurdly slow, but having said that, it&apos;s bearable. The plot sequence&apos;s delivered well. I personally think that the original idea was good, the cinematography was done beautifully, but the drama execution (esp. the dialogues) was pretty lame nonetheless; perhaps that&apos;s due to its not-well-written script. Hence the mediocrity.\n\nLove for Sale 2 (2019) doesn&apos;t emulate its predecessor, albeit still uses the same formula, namely the love-for-hire premise; only this time, the dimension of drama scope is broadened out around Arini&apos;s role. Arini returns in a totally different setting. The script&apos;s still written by the same duo; now it&apos;s about a 32 year-old single guy named Indra Tauhid (Adipati Dolken) who&apos;s tired of matchmaking by his mother, hires some woman&apos;s service from--the same dating app called--Love Inc. to calm his mother dismay. While the prequel focuses on a gloomy lonely man with his bittersweet game of love; this sequel concentrates on a lovely light-family-theme drama. What a surprise.\n\nThis sequel&apos;s enlivened by the role of Rosmaida (Ratna Riantiarno) as Indra&apos;s mother; the story then works even better when Arini and Rosmaida intertwine to form a heartwarming bond. Arini&apos;s hired by Indra to pretend to be someone she&apos;s not but, unexpectedly, she winds up being a solace to Indra&apos;s family. Arini&apos;s existence makes a big difference which later impacts slowly on Indra&apos;s feeling towards her. While most characters&apos; performance are likeable, the clear standout is Arini&apos;s relationship with Indra&apos;s family.\n\nLove for Sale 2 portrays a relatable family drama significantly. The conflicts that surround the family is basically reflections of the Indonesian family nowadays: Marriage and its problematic issues amidst Indonesian society norms. The storyline runs smoothly from start to finish. The plot pace and sequence are easy to keep up. The viewers will get to see some visual treats that are flaunted by the filmmakers, e.g. the insightful traditional wedding scene that&apos;s shot in one long take and lovely view of the city. The movie tone looks warm. Somehow, they also have managed to capture an honest nuance of the Indonesian life to the screen. The film scores are just suitable for the family theme. Kudos to the team.\n\nUnfortunately, while all the casts got indepth character development, Arini&apos;s character remains vague. The audience&apos;s not been given any of her background information whatsoever. The film ends rather abruptly. It feels a bit rushed with poor conclusion. Audience&apos;s left with strange feeling of uncertainty. Some viewers need clarity. However, Love for Sale 2 is easily a pretty good wholesome family entertainment.\n\n6/10', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",3.5,17+,"['Drama', 'Romance']",2019-10-31,0,PT1H32M,"[{'name': 'Della Dartyan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9659451/'}, {'name': 'Adipati Dolken', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668024/'}, {'name': 'Ratna Riantiarno', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1234078/'}]","[{'name': 'Andibachtiar Yusuf', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3445219/'}]","[{'name': 'Mohammad Irfan Ramly', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6579202/'}, {'name': 'Andibachtiar Yusuf', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3445219/'}]",0.0,0.0

And we never really know how he got there or why the villain chose that as his headquarters but there we are, disbelief suspended, rooting for our hero. The malevolent villain in his malevolent fortress surrounded by malevolent underlings. But - and this is important - we expected that from Bond. After all, the ENTIRE WORLD was at stake. And what better to bring down the world than a fortress?\n\nIn &apos;Luther: The Fallen Sun&apos;, the entire world is not at stake. Given, a lot of innocent people do die, but does our villain really need a faraway fortress? No, of course not. But &apos;Luther&apos;s ...&apos; got one. And, if actor Idris Elba were auditioning to be the next Bond, it would make sense to have the film&apos;s climax at that fortress. It would make sense for Luther - like Bond in Casino Royale - to be tied up and tortured at that fortress. It would make sense for Luther - like Bond - to battle the bureaucracy and have it&apos;s female head - like Bond&apos;s &apos;M&apos; - become an important ally. Yes, at that fortress.\n\nThis Luther is unlike any that came before. And that is a bad thing, make no mistake. Do not go into this looking for London, or grit, or romance, or anything that made Luther, &apos;Luther&apos;. In one early scene we see Luther posing atop a skyscraper, the camera rolling back from him, showing him off as a Batman-like super hero. Which, as we Luther fans know, he is not.\n\nPeople are being killed all over London. What do they all have in common? Only Luther can figure it out. And he does. And we have no idea &apos;how&apos;. He just does. Down to the most minute detail. He just does. And the &apos;who&apos; behind the killings; he figures that out as well, and with ridiculous ease.\n\nLuther is jailed early in the film (a totally unnecessary plot development). Why? The answer is vague but he does escape jail with - yes - ridiculous ease. And like every stereotypical thriller, locating the villain becomes personal. In this case it&apos;s the female head of police - like Bond&apos;s &apos;M&apos; - who is imperiled.\n\nI could go on. There&apos;s the whole Norway &apos;business&apos; .... but enough. This Luther is bad stuff and if anyone tells you it ain&apos;t, that person (a) never watched the earlier Luthers and / or (b) should never be listened-to about anything, ever again.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 2}}",3.2,R,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']",2023-03-10,"psychological thriller,serial killer,ice,cybercrime,blackmail",PT2H9M,"[{'name': 'Idris Elba', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/'}, {'name': 'Cynthia Erivo', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7248827/'}, {'name': 'Andy Serkis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785227/'}]","[{'name': 'Jamie Payne', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668350/'}]","[{'name': 'Neil Cross', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189232/'}]",4.25,3.4

Surprisingly, the elements of the franchise is still there and the film does not feel strangely different like in most sequels. Except, this one has a larger scale and crazier action. Well, Dreamworks Animation has gone to a new level in animation. Bringing a quicker, bigger, and more spectacular visuals to the film and make it a non-stop ride and worth it in 3D. But it&apos;s still not as compelling as any other classic animation films. The only purpose of these Madagascar films is to have fun and it truly succeeds in doing that.\n\nIt has the same old trope of the series. The gang trying to get back to New York then they suddenly bumped into new friends and they end up lingering to their situation and an old lady hates Alex the Lion. The penguins having the best gags and King Julien being crazy. It&apos;s delightful and the fans will be pleased for seeing these again. The new characters are as likable as the original characters. While everything is fun, the wonderful visuals adds the film&apos;s enjoyment. There are plenty of sequences that are meant to be seen in the big screen, either in 2D or 3D.\n\nSome scenes are ridiculously exciting, some are awfully eye-candy. The film itself is like a spectacular show with so many wonderful colors. But it does not go beyond that. The film only wants to be big, fun, and nothing else. Just make sure you are not looking for more than mind-blowing visuals. The jokes are still pretty hilarious. You will still root for these characters. There is no need to tell how was the voice acting because all of them are predictably good.\n\nMadagascar 3 is the most gorgeous part of the series but not quite the best. The trilogy will probably remain only as a little cult classic. We loved the humor, the characters, and their crazy antics. The movies have heart but there is a little impact to their drama. It&apos;s not something like Pixar. But these Madagascar films have their own personality and we accepted it. Talking animals escaping and creating some disaster. Slow moments with clever and sometimes slapstick gags. If you are a fan of these films then you will see something spectacular to it, but like I said, there is nothing bigger than that.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",3.4,PG,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']",2012-06-08,"blockbuster,animal,circus,penguin,lemur",PT1H35M,"[{'name': 'Ben Stiller', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774/'}, {'name': 'Jada Pinkett Smith', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000586/'}, {'name': 'Chris Rock', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001674/'}]","[{'name': 'Eric Darnell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201509/'}, {'name': 'Tom McGrath', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569891/'}, {'name': 'Conrad Vernon', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0970447/'}]","[{'name': 'Eric Darnell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201509/'}, {'name': 'Noah Baumbach', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000876/'}, {'name': 'Mark Burton', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123666/'}]",3.6,3.9

It leaves out some crucial parts of the novel. Moreover, the characters in the novel are very well developed. The movie somehow fails to show this. I can understand that there were time constraints and the movie is already longer than the usual 2 hours but some important sequences, like the love story between the Chairman and Sayuri needed more development. As a director, Marshall does not do a bad job at all. He&apos;s the one who gives the film an enchanting feeling. With the spectacular visuals he presents a lot of subtle symbolism. Actually, what really makes &apos;Memoirs of a Geisha&apos; watchable is that it&apos;s fascinating to look at. The dazzling colourful visuals and mesmerizing soundtrack are incredible. The shots of the landscape, the costumes, the choreography and the spectacular cinematography are breathtaking.\n\nI wonder why three Chinese actresses were cast in the main roles? I can understand why this would upset some Japanese people. My Japanese friend joked that it was perhaps because Japanese actresses don&apos;t speak good English. Though, the most likely reason for Ziyi, Yeoh and Li&apos;s casting may be their international appeal (as they are quite well known throughout the world) and that Li and Yeoh are also accomplished actresses while Ziyi is kind of a star.\n\nAmong the performances, it is the supporting cast who stand out. Zhang Ziyi lacks the liveliness and curiosity of Sayuri. Ziyi seems to be too conscious of the fact that she&apos;s only acting. Even child actress Suzuka Ohgo, who plays young Sayuri, does a better job. Youki Kudoh gets more scope to perform near the end and does a decent job. Gong Li is superb as the wicked fiery Hatsumomo (but, sadly, her character is one-dimensional) and an enigmatic Michelle Yeoh is equally outstanding as the once divine geisha Mameha. Among the men, it is Kôji Yakusho who impresses as the brave but stubborn Nobu. Ken Watanabe is alright.\n\nTo sum it up, I loved watching &apos;Memoirs of a Geisha&apos; mainly because it was very pleasing to the eyes. Marshall has handled plenty of sequences beautifully but it lacks a stronger heart (perhaps this is due to miscasting Zhang Ziyi). Having read the book, I&apos;m not that disappointed as, even though some parts have been left out, not too much has been altered. Thus, it tries to stay true to the book. I think it also introduces the beauty of the ancient Japanese culture quite sensibly.

Peter Berg direction is on steroids with his quick fast editing cuts in every action scene that makes Jason Bourne movies or Michael Bay&apos;s action seem more still. Which is not a good thing for Mile 22. Peter Berg does build some intensity that keeps your heart pumping in such a short run time with the film. He did great in Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. Mile 22 fails to be an exciting great movie. \n\nThe plot was convoluted. It follows James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) who is a paramilitary operative in an organization called Overwatch. When his team invades what they think is a Russian KGB hideout house and the mission goes sideways. A year or so later, James and his team are assigned to escort Li Noor (Iko Uwais) 22 miles to the airport for extraction. Cause Li Noor has valuable intel that can be life threatening to the nation. While on their transport they get invaded by assassins, and another paramilitary group that will stop at nothing to kill Li Noor. \n\nI thought the plot and direction of the movie was a little lost on what it was trying to be. Story wise it kind of sucked when there was barely much of a story. You have a fast talking James Silva, who can explode with his mania personality at any given moment. He is hard with his team which they can barely keep up. Especially, Alice (Lauren Cohan) who is struggling with a divorce and custody battle. But James informs her that she is distracted and will lose sight of their job. Then, there is a sub plot of a Russian terrorist that are on a plane with an agenda as they watch surveillance of this escort on Li Noor. And than Li Noor, who has info of the terrorist having a biohazard material that is an attack waiting to happen. The film has a twist that gives you the chills and a cliffhanger ending that leaves for a sequel. \n\nThe direction sucked with this movie. The cinematography work was consist of shaky camera movement and fast editing. The fight scene with Iko Uwais attacking others was confusing. The shootouts were loud, and a bang but it gets very repetitive throughout. James and his team are on a long 22 mile journey that is consist of cars blowing up, shoot outs, running into a building with more shoot outs and close combat fighting. And repeat. I like most Peter Berg films. Yes, he does well building up the intensity with the movie. But this one does get a little boring with its narration when it cuts between action scenes to James Silva being interviewed on what went wrong with their mission. Or when it cuts to surveillance videos of the action from the drone or street cameras. It can be annoying. \n\nMark Wahlberg was great though as the fast talking and maniac character. John Malkovich was okay too with sitting behind the monitors watching the action unfold. Lauren Cohan was okay as well with hands on action. Iko Uwais is like the next Jet Li or Jackie Chan when it comes to fighting. And Ronda Rousey barely had much to do with some brief action scenes.\n\nOverall, Mile 22 is a bad film. Mark Wahlberg was good and yes the film could be a start of a franchise. Peter Berg&apos;s fast editing direction that gets lost with its action scenes between quick camera movements to surveillance cameras can be tedious after awhile. The poor plotting that needs to have a twist to make it better just feels like the film did not have a story at all.

This meta self-awareness continues throughout the piece, though to varying degrees, and is especially evident in the opening musical number in which the characters sing about doing a sequel. The first film must be based on a &apos;true story&apos;, though, because its events (the muppets getting back together, Walter being introduced) are directly referenced as having happened to the muppets even though the opening makes it explicit that the film itself is the reason for the muppet&apos;s reunion and subsequent success (which kicks in prior to their picture even being edited, since this starts as soon as they shoot the last shot and wrap up production). Confused? Well, the flick doesn&apos;t want you to think about it. It steams ahead with almost reckless abandon, unconcerned with most of its throwaway humour, which leads to a &apos;just go with it&apos; vibe and prevents any semblance of self-seriousness. It&apos;s a distinct yet mostly successful approach that fits with the inherent silliness of the age-old &apos;puppets and people&apos; concept. The flick is enjoyable enough for what it is, filled with a host colourful core characters and a slew of throwaway yet inoffensive celebrity cameos. There are plenty of lively musical numbers and the piece is relatively funny on occasion (though never side-splitting, by any means). A lot of the comedy is based around ever-so-slightly xenophobic stereotypes, but this feels more lazy than malicious. Therefore, it isn&apos;t particularly bothersome, even though it does make a lot of the movie seem somewhat old-fashioned. The most successful aspects of the feature are its villains, a dastardly doppelgänger and an in-the-closet furry. Their evil plan is as predictable as you&apos;d expect, but the picture doesn&apos;t make a point of focusing on its plot and just uses it as a catalyst for its somewhat creaky comedy and its catchy song-and-dance routines (the latter of which includes an excellent 80s pop-ballad parody). Ultimately, this is a well-executed and generally enjoyable affair. There isn&apos;t anything particularly wrong with it, but it&apos;s only ever so engaging or, even, entertaining. It&apos;s good enough for a bit of throwaway fun, though. To be fair, it never pretends to be anything more than that. 6/10.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 6}}",3.2,PG,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Crime']",2014-03-21,"puppet,gulag,fairy godmother character,miss piggy character,swedish chef character",PT1H47M,"[{'name': 'Ricky Gervais', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315041/'}, {'name': 'Ty Burrell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123092/'}, {'name': 'Tina Fey', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275486/'}]","[{'name': 'James Bobin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090386/'}]","[{'name': 'James Bobin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090386/'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Stoller', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831557/'}, {'name': 'Jim Henson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345/'}]",2.9,4.0

His odyssey takes him to a world of the homeless, including an illiterate Scot (Trainspotting&apos;s Ewen Bremner) and his long suffering girlfriend (Susan Vidler) and a lonely nightwatchman (Peter Wight) guarding empty space. It&apos;s during this lengthy scene that David Thewlis proves to be one of the most versatile actors of his generation, delivering a speech of bleak complexity and pre-millennial doom that leaves most viewers reeling. Juxtaposed with Johnny is Louise&apos;s rapist Yuppie landlord (Greg Cruttwell), perhaps the weakest character in the movie. He&apos;s rich, crass and brutal, but also appears to be a sneering cartoon character, overshadowed by Johnny&apos;s hard edged intellect.

A bitter tale of loneliness, depression and Thatcher&apos;s wasted youth that seemed to be forgotten by most home grown film-makers in the mad rush to emulate Wall Street. Had a bad day?

One could never have predicted the depth she gives to her character here. She plays a sexless, Christian housewife whose husband (John Diehl) suffers from a stroke. It comes to light that, though he refuses to sleep with her, he frequents the local sperm bank. Harris feels betrayed, but her husband is at death&apos;s door, so she attempts to forgive him. He mutters, perhaps from delirium, that she needs to find a long lost son, and she sets out to find the young man. Matt O&apos;Leary plays the drug addict she finds, and, attempting to escape the sheriff, he takes off with her on a road trip. O&apos;Leary is quite good himself, but, again, it&apos;s Harris&apos; movie. The film starts off a little snarky about the whole situation, but Harris takes her character&apos;s dilemma seriously and plays her as a woman in deep emotional turmoil.

It touches quite a few nerves in a state that it caught up in a highly divisive debate over its gun laws. Even though everyone walking into the theater saw the news coverage of December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook massacre and knows exactly what happened, the film is hypnotic, powerful and emotionally overwhelming. It is mostly presented through interviews with family members, teachers, a priest, and first responders. They all tell the tale of the tragedy that scarred their small idyllic Connecticut town. The film focuses on three families that were willing to open up and tell some of the stories of the deaths of their children and how those deaths tore their lives apart. The small details and family photos are perhaps the most devastating. The film is done with great care, skill and humanity. The killer&apos;s name is never verbalized (and only briefly displayed in some documents on the screen) and his story is not really explored. There is clearly a political agenda at work and film is clearly advocating for more gun control, but that is secondary to presenting a human portrait of the young lives were tragically cut short. Sandy Hook has become the emotional touchstone of the gun debate, because the children were so young and so innocent. The families seem to be resilient and willing to carry on and fight for better laws to save other children from meeting the same tragic fate. The film is haunting and left much of the audience trying to hold back tears.

The concept may not sound so original, but the designs and the themes of the story are the main appeal here. The movie is fun and wonderful to look at. While it goes through a crazy adventure comedy, there is a surprising twist that made this so endearing. It is something that we don&apos;t usually see in an animated film, but because of that we intend to love it. ParaNorman is funny, creepy, smart, and affecting.\n\nParaNorman is oddly different as an animated family film. Unlike the others, this one has a dark and mature context, but by sentimental means. Although the story is about spirits and zombies, the true core of this film is the emotion and the message that it is trying to show us. There&apos;s a couple of moments that are quite affecting. Usually is when Norman is being alone in his gloomy life. In other parts, the film is ought to be funny. The comedy sometimes feel way apart from the drama, but they still work anyway.\n\nThe stop-motion animation indeed looks marvelous. These little figures really brought themselves to life as their voice actors provide their personalities. The campiest part, the zombies, are quite impressive to look at. It&apos;s undeniably solid. The music score sure knows which part is suppose to be gloomy, campy, or just ordinary. It&apos;s a great effect to the scenes and you&apos;ll love it. The rest of the movie is all ridiculous and fun little set pieces that are entertaining enough to enjoy.\n\nParaNorman is surprisingly strong. The depth of the story made this movie so special. It&apos;s still filled with comedy and lightheartedness. In the end, it turns out to be endearing. It&apos;s a rare kind of family film that is brave to show what it wanted to show. It might be hard for some to understand its sentiment, but if there&apos;s anything else why anyone would like this film then it&apos;s because of its majestic animation.

The company who has developed this technology is run like a massive biotech that has Apple like meetings where awards like salesperson of the year are awarded...but the real reason people attend is to hear the CEO speak, a Olivia Theissen. The recipient of the best salesperson award is Max, who we follow throughout the film.\n\nIn essence the film is almost a de-evolution of Max&apos;s beliefs. In the beginning he is very pro-company and really believes in what they are doing in the most altruistic sense, which is part of what makes him a great salesperson...visiting refugees in a refugee camp and convincing young refugees to donate just 5-10 years for the money to help their entire families immigrate. When his doctor wife is forced to give up 40 years after their home is burnt down...he starts to see things from a different perspective. Meanwhile there is an activist group who believes so strongly against this company and it&apos;s practices that they are willing to commit violent crimes like murder.\n\nInteresting from a psychological perspective, I enjoyed this German Sci-fi film...not as much as I enjoyed the Dark series, but I did enjoy it.

Wasn&apos;t all that enamoured by the trailers and advertising, which dampened my expectations a little but saw it anyway as &apos;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&apos; is one of my favourite Beatrix Potter stories. \n\nFound &apos;Peter Rabbit&apos; to be much better than expected. It is not perfect and there are better family films out there, but it was hugely entertaining and charming that is ideal for kids and adults. It has endured, and will continue to endure, the wrath of those expecting a straight up adaptation of the story. Understandable, as the title and advertising made it seem as if it was going to be with a modern twist. This is misleading, it is not a straight up adaptation and wasn&apos;t trying to be from my personal perspective (more of a modern day follow-up) which is very likely to be wrong. It is best judged as a standalone, on that front there is a lot to enjoy. \n\nOh, and the allergy bullying controversy does seem as if it has been blown out of proportion for a scene that was over very quickly and didn&apos;t seem that insensitive or distasteful, or at least to me. \n\nSure, &apos;Peter Rabbit&apos; does have the odd joke that is a little too repetitive, a notable one being with Pigling Bland. Some of the second half is predictable where it is easy to see where it&apos;s all going to go, some of the supporting characters are underused (there could have been more of Jeremy Fisher and Jemima Puddle Duck for examples) and maybe there could have been less narration. Regarding the last point though, it is delivered beautifully by Margot Robbie and captures the storybook nature of some of the storytelling very well.\n\nHowever, even with the witty modern setting, the quaint nature of Potter&apos;s stories is intact and loved the affectionate references to other Potter characters in other stories of hers and it even includes the style of her illustrations at points. \n\n&apos;Peter Rabbit&apos; manages to be enormously entertaining, a vast majority of the jokes do hit the mark and they are very funny to hilarious. Especially the scene-stealing cockerel, Mrs Tiggy Winkle and the electric fence and Peter&apos;s sisters, while the very physical and increasingly violent comedy that Domhnall Gleeson is given to do is a lot of fun and didn&apos;t feel gratuitous, cartoonish or mean-spirited.\n\nIt&apos;s not just about the comedy. There is a heart too with well-meaning messaging and the whole stuff with Peter&apos;s parents and past was very heartfelt. There is a natural charm with the character interaction, and the relationship between Thomas and Bea is very sweet. All the characters engage, the soundtrack is suitably peppy, everything goes at a lively pace and can find little if any fault with the cast. Gleeson makes Thomas more than just a standard clichéd archetype that he appears to be at first and manages the difficult physical comedy and the difficult task of interacting in real life with nothing with ease. Rose Byrne is effortlessly charming without being sugary or without substance, her chemistry with Gleeson and the animals is sweet. James Corden is a likeable Peter and Robbie and Daisy Ridley are particularly colourful of the supporting voice cast. Didn&apos;t recognise Sam Neill. \n\nThe visual look of &apos;Peter Rabbit&apos; is one of its biggest pleasures. It is very colourful and picturesque with beautiful photography, that is never garish or flat, and there is a seamless blending of CGI and live-action. The CGI itself is simply great and is so well blended that one can&apos;t tell that it&apos;s CGI. \n\nOverall, very enjoyable and much better than expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.3,SU,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Crime']",2018-02-23,"rabbit,deer,mouse,fox,pig",PT1H35M,"[{'name': 'James Corden', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179479/'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2417960/'}, {'name': 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1727304/'}]","[{'name': 'Will Gluck', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323239/'}]","[{'name': 'Rob Lieber', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1464577/'}, {'name': 'Will Gluck', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323239/'}, {'name': 'Beatrix Potter', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0693229/'}]",2.8,3.2

We only got Jungle Book as the only one worth watching, everything else are either decent or just okay. Now the movie is released, I can already see a good reason people will debate this and the 2019 Lion King. The 2022 Pinocchio remake may not be the worst Disney Plus film, but this could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. There are Pinocchio movies out there that do try to find a way to tell the story of the character well. But this is more of a recycled film from the original 1940 one. Despite it does have some of the performances that&apos;s fateful to the original film, it had a weak execution with a poorly written story, mediocre characters, overly dark setups, and awful looking visuals. The one thing I&apos;ll say the visuals got right is with Pinocchio himself. But for the most part, they can be out of place and most of the designs try way too hard to make animal characters realistic. I mean, we already gotten Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale. What more do you want to do all that in, Disney Plus? Of course as a painfully pointless live action Disney remake, I recommend to skip this one and stick with the original film. But you know what, let&apos;s all be thankful at least we&apos;re getting the one by Del Toro at the end of the year. When that gets released, I can guarantee it will be the one you&apos;d want to watch instead.

New girl Yolanda is put under the guidance of Zahra, a senior girl with a good reputation who always obeys her teachers. It is clear that the girls are being raised as Muslims but there is something suspicious about their teacher. He instructs the girls to perform a ceremony to summon their Qorin Jinns... doppelgängers. They are wary but ultimately do as instructed. It isn&apos;t long before strange things start to occur. The teacher now has power over them and his intentions are far from righteous. The girls will have to be strong and hold firm to their faith if they are to defeat him.\n\nThis might not be the best horror film I&apos;ve seen but it was enjoyable. It had plenty of creepy moments and a few good scares. The story is effective even if, like me, you aren&apos;t familiar with the culture. While it may not be in the same class, the film this reminded me of most was &apos;The Exorcist&apos;. Like that classic the evil is confronted by religious faith and a willingness to risk all... there is even a scene where a girl does the famous &apos;spider walk&apos;! The cast does a solid job and the special effects are pretty good. On the down side things are a bit too dark at times making it hard to see what is going on. Overall a decent enough film that I&apos;d recommend to fans of religious horror films looking for something set somewhere different.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Indonesian with English subtitles.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",2.5,17+,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",2022-12-01,"ghost,islam,faith,boarding school,student",PT1H49M,"[{'name': 'Zulfa Maharani', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8746190/'}, {'name': 'Omar Daniel', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11810208/'}, {'name': 'Aghniny Haque', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9321612/'}]","[{'name': 'Ginanti Rona', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4176405/'}]","[{'name': 'Lele Laila', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5193944/'}, {'name': 'Ginanti Rona', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4176405/'}]",4.75,3.35

Over The Top because there&apos;s a man, his son, and a truck. Rocky because it&apos;s obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it&apos;s excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It&apos;s also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.\n\nThe premise isn&apos;t really that intriguing. It&apos;s boxing replaced by robots. Films with Giant CGI Robots are not innovating since we have Michael Bay&apos;s Transformers. But the heart and soul lies to the relationship of Charlie and Max and their robot, Atom. It&apos;s fun to watch them. The fighting scenes are pretty exciting. That is what most underdog fighting movies do. The only problem here is the weak major antagonist. It&apos;s not really that threatening or a big deal. Ricky was more threatening than the gigantic Zeus.\n\nThe filmmaking is pretty decent. Well shot scenes. The CGI robots and the music score are good enough. Nothing to say about the production design except Charlie&apos;s truck. It looks fascinating for some reason. The performances were great. We don&apos;t see Hugh Jackman in action movies after two years and there&apos;s a small cameo of him, flipping off two characters(it&apos;s obvious but I won&apos;t tell you the title). Here in Real Steel, Jackman is energetic and somewhat perfect for the role. Dakota Goyo is a bit charming. Chemistry of him and Jackman shines through the film. It&apos;s fun to watch them together.\n\nThere aren&apos;t much new here in Real Steel but in the end, it&apos;s enjoyable and has plenty of heart. The climax isn&apos;t so much overwhelming but it intends to be more heartfelt. Again, it&apos;s like Over The Top which the father is trying to make his son proud and Rocky because it&apos;s boxing and add some robots in it. Even without thinking much about the robots, there is always human heart in this film. Hugh Jackman does it again. The underdog fighting movie genre does it again.

Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who&apos;d read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I&apos;d ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there&apos;s nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I &apos;saw&apos; them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates&apos; novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don&apos;t think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn&apos;t already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I&apos;d watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight.

What they&apos;re working on now is as the leads in team that is tracking down a serial killer who likes to leave little poetical epitaphs behind for each victim.\n\nThe plot here is borrowed from Magnum Force, but in that film, Hal Holbrook has recruited a personal death squad from among the young officers of the San Francisco PD. and Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is trying to solve the case. When these guys do figure it out that it&apos;s a cop doing the killing, it&apos;s one individual however doing it on their own.\n\nThis is not a harmonious team that Lieutenant Brian Dennehy has put together. Carla Gugino is trying to show she&apos;s as tough as the men and a couple of younger detectives, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are wanting bad to show up the older Pacino and DeNiro. \n\nRighteous Kill is pure gold when the two acting legends are on the screen together. When the attention is not on them however, the story does drag a bit in spots.

Colman Domingo plays the role of Rustin -- he will without doubt be a nominee for best actor. Surprise cast (to me): Chris Rock played Roy Wilkins and gave a wonderful performance. One highlight of our showing: the presentation opened with a video appearance and introduction by one of the executive producers: Barack Obama. Obama was a real producer and was even involved in review of the script. As President, he posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Part of the positives here comes from the decision to focus on a wholly undervalued aspect of the creatures&apos; legend by incorporating the cursed lineage origin story for the creature rather than the black magic route. That so few are aware that the true nature of the creature can be spread in that manner makes the storyline feel fresh and unique, especially with the build-up here to get the revelation about her real history. This is told in vivid dreams and flashbacks that contain the agony of being such a fearsome creature yet powerless to do anything about it as she slowly comes to be aware of her situation. That all makes the ensuing love triangle between her and the two guys feel impactful as the reassuring nature they provide rekindling the romance helps to ease her mind and forget the situation as they both truly care for her best interests once the secret is finally revealed. The romantic angle that emerges from that storyline setup is heartfelt and emotional, adding plenty of deep resonance to the horror that arises later on. On top of that, the film works incredibly well with the suspenseful stalking out in the local forest. From the opening game of hide-and-seek inside the abandoned building in the middle of the forest to the Krasue hunts the villagers partake in that are illuminated only by torches, the atmosphere is incredibly impressive and chilling and providing the early reasoning for the paranoia behind the villagers&apos; increasingly desperate need to find the creature responsible when added alongside the mounting animal corpses. The actual attack scenes themselves, with the actual separation of the head from the body being shown and following the floating head flying through the village and surrounding jungle with the red eyes glowing brightly against the darkened backdrop are especially eerie and chilling. As well, the encounter with the villagers looking to find the creature in the little girl showcases the fine mix of practical and CGI effects for the creature and adds more to like about this one. The biggest determining factor in the film will undoubtedly be the central romance. The idea of being able to love such a hideous, bloodsucking creature capable of dealing out the violence and terror on the villagers comes through rather strongly here, what with him shown feeding it dead birds and animals to keep her from attacking others or standing by each other&apos;s side despite the accusations from the other villagers to put her to death. Taking the finale into account as well, with the decision to stand up to the monstrous creature before him despite still being a simple human and then going away together to save each other from the villagers adds even more to the romantic sideplot throughout the film. Even looking at the race to cure her with the local medicine adds to the emotional impact of their relationship, bringing about an issue that might not be welcome for some who prefer more of a horror-based storyline. The sappiness from these scenes might turn viewers off as well as be seen as the reason why the film&apos;s as long as it is, especially with the constant slow-motion that drags these out to supposedly hammer home the weight behind the action. However, that is the only true flaw to be had with the film.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}",3.2,17+,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Romance']",2019-08-21,0,PT2H2M,"[{'name': 'Phantira Pipityakorn', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10464505/'}, {'name': 'Oabnithi Wiwattanawarang', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6694718/'}, {'name': 'Sapol Assawamunkong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10464506/'}]","[{'name': 'Sitisiri Mongkolsiri', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10041917/'}]","[{'name': 'Sitisiri Mongkolsiri', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10041917/'}, {'name': 'Chookiat Sakveerakul', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1840848/'}]",0.0,0.0

Now someone had the idea to shoot a movie that rises some doubts about the complete moral failure of Christianity in this matter, and two big numbers from the Hollywood&apos;s actor&apos;s scene agreed to participate.\n\nMaybe Nicholas Cage and Ron Pearlman read only their remuneration proposals, not the script. Four out of four suspected witches in this movie are possessed by the evil, so, torturer&apos;s where right, that&apos;s the message in the first place. It&apos;s like to say the Jews earned their holocaust because they all conspired to bring German society down.\n\nNevertheless, historically the Jews, although they died at the same rate of this disease, were blamed for the Black Plague and were assaulted and wiped out widely in Europe, since no doctor knew where the plague came from, and medicine didn&apos;t exist as a science but as Alchemy. Witch persecution began about a hundred years later and ended in the 18th century. And, for the record, the Black plague is still active today.\n\nSecond, when it comes to the crusades, the two heroes in this twisted holy buddy movie turn their backs on their unholy duty only when they kill some European looking females, and the countless other murders they committed are somewhere rightful, because they were misled by the catholic church, poor soldiers with bloody swords but well-hearted to the core.\n\nThe movie, with those two hypocrisies in mind, is something that should not happen and should not be shown and should not be watched, as it is far away from any truth but claims to have some. As far as we know, most of US history productions are far from history, and people do not care and watch those abominations like the Germans watched propaganda movies during the NS regime.\n\nYou can call it merely moronic and enjoy some medieval atmosphere and the professional but not really participating acting of two big names, along with some CGI at SyFy level and a tiny adventurous plot. Popcorn-cinema, and there are uncounted numbers of such movies, produced only to keep the industry running.\n\nUnfortunately, there are subliminal messages coming along with the historical pretension.

Professionally, he is the PA to Dr. Acharya (Nasser) the lead scientist at NIFR and is absolutely convinced that his boss is fooling the world with his wacky research on alien microbes but puzzled about how convincing and confident the latter is, in getting away with lies. With the birth of Mani&apos;s son Adi, he hatches a grand plot of exhibiting his slow learner kid to the world as a prodigy and a genius in the making, thus achieving the extraordinary aspiration of societal recognition and adulation.\n\nAdi grows confident due to Mani&apos;s incessant guidance, illegitimate mechanisms for catapulting him to fame and popularity, using which the latter gains the recognition that he otherwise would never have achieved. It&apos;s a grand secret between the father and the son, but like all good things, it must come to an end. The repressed childhood of Adi, and his inability to act without assistance slowly starts getting to the child, something that can potentially destroy him mentally. Mani has to find an exit strategy to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Adi, and is ready to pay the price for it.\n\nSerious Men, directed by Sudhir Mishra is a tale of a twisted mind that refuses to succumb to the ordinary and will go to any length to realize his dreams, by hook or by crook. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is par excellence as the master manipulator, who is least concerned about the lack of maturity of the young mind, piling on agony on the child with psychological overload. But Serious Men belongs to the child artist Akshath Das, who absolutely captivates with his charm, innocence and complex psychological emotional demonstration, especially when he is unable to handle the burden any longer. Serious Men is a diabolical essay that waltzes on the screen in the garb of a socio-comic drama that gradually returns the young mind to sanity and normalcy, but not without collateral damages.

Yes, they are bullied and yes you could definitely say that the male boss - Rick, played by Taye Diggs - is a bit of a two dimensional caricature.

But things take a turn for the worst when a member of the group is attacked by a shark. Isolated with no cell service and no help in sight, the group quickly realizes they are on their own, but the water around them is not safe. \n\nI wanted Shark Night 3D to be as fun as Piranha 3D was last year. Despite the PG-13 rating, I held onto a desperate hope that it would somehow manage to live up to that level of gleeful insanity and absolutely ridiculous trashiness. I knew deep down it would never be anywhere near comparable, but everything about the film suggested it would be an enjoyable ride.\n\nSadly, this is not the case.\n\nInstead of getting a ridiculous movie about sharks mauling pretty 20- somethings that embraces the sheer silliness of the very idea, we get a deadly serious, high-concept slasher film that seems to have no concept of what fun is. Sure we get the typical horror movie wise ass quips sprinkled here and there, and some rather intriguing reasoning as to why the attacks are occurring. But in-between these moments, we get stilted dialogue, wooden performances, characters with next to no dimensionality whatsoever, and just about nothing else. Despite it being 2011, the film feels like it belongs to a different era – one where it has not realized how outrageous and frivolous the genre has become. It offers nothing new by way of ideas or story, and somehow thinks an ode to Jaws at the beginning of the film is appropriate. I initially wanted to criticize Shark Night for cribbing from Piranha. But in watching the film, it is obvious they learned absolutely nothing from Alexandre Aja and his crew. \n\nBut while the bad story and worse acting are to be expected, what is really disappointing is just how much of a grand tease the whole movie is. The rating may be a contributing factor, but the only thing it seems to cut out is gratuitous nudity. The T and A is still plentiful, and the film is actually surprisingly graphic in some instances. But the majority of deaths, the best part of any slasher film, are merely hinted at. We see characters get pulled underwater, and just when you think we will see their grisly end, the film inexplicably cuts to the next scene. Hell, we do not even get the obligatory shot confirming that a character did indeed die. How do we know they did not manage to fight off the shark and survive to fight another day? And since there are about ten people in the entire cast, most of which meet an untimely end, that is a whole lot of teasing and not a lot of pay off. I can only think of one that is explicitly shown, and even that seemed like it was pushing it based on what happens during the rest of the film. It is all very arbitrary, but it seems like a rather obscene faux pas on the part of the filmmakers. \n\nRemember how comically bad and exaggerated the piranha looked in Piranha 3D? Somehow, the sharks in Shark Night 3D look even worse. There is nothing realistic about them. They look more cartoonish than anything, standing out as not even attempting to look like they belong in any of the scenes. They make memories of the shark from Jaws appear more frighteningly authentic than I thought possible. But this is only when the sharks are swimming around underwater, looking menacing and hungry . When they actually interact with the characters, they look absolutely absurd and preposterous. A shot involving a shark leaping out of the water to attack one of the characters as he zips by on a jet-ski looks even worse than those ludicrously awful effects you may have seen from Shark Attack 3: Megalodon. They may actually qualify for some of the worst effects in the past decade. Surely the special effects team realized they were working on an actual movie with a budget, and not some straight-to-DVD Asylum knockoff. So what could possibly be there excuse for such a terrible job? \n\nI think the only thing I remotely enjoyed was how impressive the underwater shots looked in 3D. They were clearly shot with the format in mind, and look absolutely stunning even with a fake shark in the background. They frequently took me entirely out of the film, as they look like they belong in a significantly better project. The shots are just so tranquil and so beautiful that they may make you forget what an awful movie you are sitting through. With the exception of an over-the- top explosion, this is just about the only thing that sizzles in 3D. There are no other elements that even attempt to take advantage of the format.\n\nWhen I tell you that Shark Night 3D is one of the worst films of the year, with next to no redeeming qualities, you better believe I am not lying. I was hoping it would be somewhat fun, but instead it was one of the most annoying and agonizing films I have ever put myself through. The film is too serious to be enjoyable, and fails to deliver in almost every respect. The filmmakers and cast should be ashamed of themselves. When the credits rolled, I could not leave the theatre fast enough because I was ashamed to have actually watched it. Apparently there is a rap music video after the credits conclude, featuring the entire cast. Somehow, I still do not think this could make up for the travesty you have to put yourself through to get to it. \n\n3/10.\n\n(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.0,PG-13,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Horror']",2011-09-02,"shark,male nudity,no cell phone signal,reference to guns n&apos; roses,3d",PT1H30M,"[{'name': 'Sara Paxton', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668139/'}, {'name': 'Dustin Milligan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1682420/'}, {'name': 'Chris Carmack', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1377001/'}]","[{'name': 'David R.

It looked entertaining enough, but I was wondering is it going to be an entertaining and stylish movie or another generic block buster? My answer is this, and you can probably tell by my summary, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is not the best movie I have ever seen and it has its faults, but the thing is I thought it was fun, witty and somewhat original too.\n\nThose who didn&apos;t like it as much as I did will probably question whether I have any knowledge at all of Sherlock Holmes, whether it is the books or the countless interpretations of the character and his stories. The answer is yes, I really like Conan Doyle&apos;s stories, they are clever and insightful and Holmes himself is a very intriguing character with a distinct personality, and I am a fan of both Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. If I had a preference I would say the latter but only marginally, Rathbone was excellent, he was sophisticated and gritty but Brett had that towering presence and generosity about him that made me like him a little more.\n\nBack to this film, I liked how it was filmed. I for one found it stylish, innovative and clever. The camera work is really good, even in the fight scenes which were suitably gritty and invigorating, and the sets, costumes and locations look as though they took their time with it and to make it true to the period. I also enjoyed the score, it was jaunty and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Guy Ritchie&apos;s direction is solid as well, it is tight, assured and Ritchie does seem to know what he is doing, so we were treated to some fun set pieces.\n\nThe pacing was fine for me, in fact although people may disagree I for one was surprised at how quickly in general the film went, even if it did slow down towards the end. The script was very witty and smart, there were a number of times when my whole family and I laughed, and a lot of it was Holmes&apos;s dialogue, plus I liked the idea of the plot, it was an original (if a little convoluted at times) and it moved along briskly. I will talk later about what didn&apos;t quite work, but in particular the final solution is interesting. It may be one you need to rewind a few times in order to completely understand though. I also think it was a good idea to put Moriaty as a background character, the ending is highly suggestive of a sequel, and if there is one that would be a perfect opportunity for Moriaty to flourish with the right actor, some good dialogue and some good character development.\n\nFinally the acting. In general, I was really impressed. Robert Downey Jnr, an actor who I like a lot, gives a very strong performance as Holmes. He plays Holmes as an avid boxer, as a keen martial artist, as intelligent being a master of logic and deduction and as a master of disguise, while tormenting his housekeeper in a playful manner and sometimes acting as selfish and self-destructive. Downey Jnr. delivers his lines pretty much brilliantly, sometimes saying them quite quickly, especially when Holmes is deducting but I loved his deadpan delivery. Jude Law is perfect as Watson, he plays him as young, intelligent, authoritative and there are some great moments when he tells Holmes off. The two do share a unique and effortless chemistry together and that really showed on screen and one of the reasons why the film was so enjoyable for me. Another strong performance is Mark Strong as Blackwood, a real villain he is, mysterious, cold, dark, suave yet charismatic yet deserving of one or two more scenes, and I liked Eddie Marsan&apos;s Inspector Lestrade.\n\nDespite all these strengths there were two primary weaknesses. While the plot was great and moved along briskly, there were some scenes that came across as rushed and unexplained, especially when Holmes and Watson save Irene Adler from being killed in the factory, that just felt like an action set piece and little else. Rachel McAdams I didn&apos;t like so much as Irene. She looks really pretty, with the lovely authentic hair style and her dresses were eye popping, especially the pinkish-red one which suited her perfectly, but acting-wise she looks stiff and unconvincing in her part.\n\nOverall, just plain fun. Whether you see it or not is up to you, if you don&apos;t like it that&apos;s fine, this film&apos;s not for everyone. But I am going to conclude to say I loved it, it was entertaining and smart. 9/10 Bethany Cox', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",3.8,13+,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery']",2009-12-27,"sherlock holmes character,scotland yard inspector,baker street london,belt,serial killer",PT2H8M,"[{'name': 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/'}, {'name': 'Jude Law', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000179/'}, {'name': 'Rachel McAdams', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097/'}]","[{'name': 'Guy Ritchie', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005363/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Robert Johnson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3467335/'}, {'name': 'Anthony Peckham', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0669756/'}, {'name': 'Simon Kinberg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334526/'}]",3.85,3.45

There was 2 storylines and no real direction for either. Then it slowly starts falling into place and it gets better and better and better. And that&apos;s the only real negative I have to offer on this film. Maybe another negative is that I personally would have liked a little more depth on the 2 police officers. You are offered very little on them and it doesn&apos;t particularly take anything away from this movie, just would have liked to have known more. Like why is he so hellbent on wanting to catch these etc\n\nBut that&apos;s honestly nit picking because this really is a great film. The idea of the past/present storylines then merging was done absolutely brilliantly and best of all his character arc was simply superb.

The movie is two hours long and is structured in a similar way to Pulp Fiction. A bunch of stories set in a consistent world, with characters falling in and out of each others plot lines. On the whole it works brilliantly, and for the duration there isn&apos;t a boring moment. It is High octane, million miles and hour storytelling, and it EASILY Robert Rodriguez&apos;s best film. Allowing Frank Miller to write the script was a fantastic move, as the dialogue is edgy, witty and VERY faithful to the original material. In fact, many many lines are just taken straight from the pages. likewise, the camera behaves like a moving cartoon box out. The framing of all the key scenes is SO faithful to the printed page that it produces a truly original look that is fairly incomparable. Visually its a true original. Sometimes these visuals fall down, there are some very very obvious digital shots that don&apos;t quite gel, but on the whole the cinematography is jaw dropping. You could literally pause the movie at almost any point and just hang that frame on a wall, its that beautiful. Performances are good all round. Mickey Rourke absolutely nails Marv, and the girls of Old Town are all as beautiful as they are deadly. The other standout for me was Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling. Bruce Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan. The film isn&apos;t entirely void of criticism. there&apos;s some fudging of time lines with Hartigans character (do we really buy Bruce Willis as a nearly 70 year old man?) and the jumps from story to story are jarring initially, but once it settles into itself the ride is fantastic. My other main criticism is the same I have with Quentin Tarantinos work. That every character and every voice in the movie is the same. This is more a fault of the source material, but when every single person is a wise cracking, hard boiled tough guy (even the women) then it kind of distills the effect of their toughness. In a film that is predominantly voice over driven, it is hard to differentiate characters when they all sound exactly the same, both tonally, and in the language they use. Even Marv, who&apos;s supposed to be a meat head, talks in gravelly prose that would make Bukowski feel like a Nancy. Other Minor niggles are hardly worth mentioning. From a technical standpoint the sound effects are WAY to loud. All of the punches, gunshots etc are given such ridiculous prominence on the track that they threaten to make mockery of the violence. I actually found that i didn&apos;t want any more guns fired cos it was hurting my ears! all in all though, its one hell of a ride, and only a couple of notches below Pulp Fiction on the &apos;Oh my god that film was cool-o-meter&apos;.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': None, 'bestRating': None, 'ratingValue': None}}",4.0,R,"['Crime', 'Thriller']",2005-04-01,"neo noir,based on graphic novel,corruption,dark horse comics,night",PT2H4M,"[{'name': 'Mickey Rourke', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620/'}, {'name': 'Clive Owen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654110/'}, {'name': 'Bruce Willis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/'}]","[{'name': 'Frank Miller', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588340/'}, {'name': 'Quentin Tarantino', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/'}, {'name': 'Robert Rodriguez', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/'}]","[{'name': 'Frank Miller', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588340/'}, {'name': 'Robert Rodriguez', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/'}]",0.0,0.0

Visually distraught, he leaves a hearing in tears and sets off a media circus. Seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was his roommate in college, and the two have remained friends. In a bid to quash the political blogging of junior reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), McAffrey sets out to find the truth about the story.\n\nState of Play sets itself up early on to be a cookie-cutter, predictable thriller. But as the film progresses, it rather quickly becomes the twisty and conniving thriller it needs to be. Despite being heavily dialogue driven, the film is an intense ride that will keep people on edge throughout. Some scenes are downright terrifying in their amped up suspense and political intrigue. This film really set out to be tense, and succeeds wonderfully. It knows just what punches to pull, and when to pull them.\n\nThe script, written by political scribes Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilory and Billy Ray, is insight and intriguing. It could have easily been made boring and inundated with rehashed politicalisms (like all of their last films), but this film revels in how interesting it becomes. It has laughs strung throughout (a genuine surprise), and lacks the nerve to become loaded to the brim with facts and innuendos. Instead, it expertly weaves between scenes, amping up the intensity of some scenes, and downplaying others.\n\nBut this is mainly due to the incredible performances by the cast. Crowe (who I usually loathe) and Affleck are simply outstanding in their roles. Age issues aside, both play their character with finesse and charisma. Affleck looks and acts like a confused wet-behind-the-ears, gunning-for-higher-office political pawn from beginning to end. Some of the reactions on his face are downright devastating in how excellently they are conveyed. And this is a guy critics once said could not act. Coupled with one-two shot of acting in Hollywoodland and directing Gone Baby Gone, we may be seeing a renewed resonance and importance for the Oscar-winner. Crowe on the other hand, delivers his strongest performance in years. While he has been downplayed and underused in his last few films, he carries this film. He is stubborn and vaguely likable, but he makes his character work for all of his idiosyncrasies and ethically-questionable tactics. He makes a seasoned journalist look like an amateur.\n\nMcAdams, all but a ghost recently, holds her own against the two heavy-hitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. It gives her a lot of room to act, and she delivers in every instance. The rest of the cast is a bit mixed however, as so little of them is given that much to do. Harry Lennix, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, the horrifying Michael Berresse and especially Jason Bateman, all deliver noteworthy performances, but never get to really shine in them. They all have their traits and motivations, but get little screen time to truly express them. They each are developed quite strongly, but they lack the movement afforded to Crowe, Affleck and McAdams. I simply loved Helen Mirren&apos;s scenery-gauging editor and all of her subtleties. But she too, is downplayed to the point of almost barely being in the film.\n\nDespite its intensity, the film is bogged down by its dialogue-heavy scenes and consistent character additions. It is easy to keep track of everyone, but so many people are introduced that the film loses its focus on more than one occasion. It makes for a few scenes that are merely filler between the scenes of useful heavy acting. It just feels so tiring. I understand now how daunting a task it must have been to convert six hours of British television into a 127-minute film, but there are scenes that are just too easy to not have been cut out (some entire mildly useful subplots may have helped). Adding characters in makes sense for a story about two journalists frantically searching to lift the lid on a story, but there needs to be more emphasis on what was needed and not needed. A brilliant montage in the middle of the film goes almost entirely to waste because the filmmakers lack the knowledge of what should be cut. Limiting the preposterous and silly climax could have also done wonders. The scenes that are left in the film (including the finale) are great, but they could have been stronger if they were as tightly wound as the film wants itself to be. A little less shaky hand camera movement could have also significantly benefited the film.\n\nEven with its problems, it is clear from the on-set of the first shot in the bullpen at the Washington Globe that the filmmakers are going for a very keen sense of homage to All the President&apos;s Men. While the on-going and very professional relationship between McAffrey and Frye is very similar to Woodward and Bernstein, the fabric of journalistic integrity and researching are the core of State of Play. The film is loaded with allusions to the Oscar-winning film, and even mimics shots right out of the film. While it is obvious for anyone who has seen Men, this film&apos;s nods are done in such a delicate and unique way that they never become distracting or blatant. The film is its own, and does not ever feel like it is living in its big-brother&apos;s shadow. It is a fresh take on old-fashioned reporting in a very digital age, and frequently walks the tight line of old versus new.\n\nState of Play looked interesting, and surprisingly delivers on almost every count. It is not a perfect film, but it is a solid example of great film-making. It wants to be more, but seems content at being a twisty and suspenseful modern thriller. \n\n8/10.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.55,PG-13,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']",2009-04-17,"conspiracy,congressman,newspaper,political conspiracy,print journalism",PT2H7M,"[{'name': 'Russell Crowe', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000128/'}, {'name': 'Rachel McAdams', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097/'}, {'name': 'Ben Affleck', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/'}]","[{'name': 'Kevin Macdonald', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531817/'}]","[{'name': 'Matthew Michael Carnahan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1996352/'}, {'name': 'Tony Gilroy', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006904/'}, {'name': 'Billy Ray', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712753/'}]",3.65,4.2

There are a couple of genuinely touching moments and it doesn&apos;t require a big time investment as the whole thing is only 6 20 minute episodes.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",3.45,0,['Comedy'],2022-11-03,"lgbt comedy,sex work,gay",0,"[{'name': 'Samuel Davison', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7247068/'}, {'name': 'Adam Fox', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6377704/'}, {'name': 'Joey Beni', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3667254/'}]",[],[],0.0,0.0

He has such a natural and believable way about him in his roles that I find it hard not to be drawn into his character.

What quickly transpires is that he is not the speed limit sticking man that his son first thought, he is actually a ex CIA agent.\n\nThis change is done very well, with a short set piece in an airport. With the smallest of physical changes, Hackman flips from average father to confident and action ready agent. You can see it in his manner, and it shows his excellent capability as an actor.\n\nThe rest of the movie reveals the story as father and son are pulled deeper and deeper into his life, revealing the true extent of his agent activities. His son quickly realises that this is not the father he knew, and quickly grows from off-handedness to total rejection and then to acceptance again.\n\nIt is an interesting movie, and the plot is quite good with some interesting action sequences. Where it fails are some of the other actors and the hectic pace of the movie, it seems as though either in filming or editing that crucial parts of the movie have been missed or removed.\n\nBig shame, but it is still good to watch for a Sunday afternoon movie.

It&apos;s gleefully OTT, the screen painted red with the blood of the guilty. The foursome -- Topan (Abimana Aryasatya), Jenggo (Arie Kriting), Alpha (Lutesha) and Pelor (Kristo Immanuel) -- have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father Petrus, whose real daughter, policewoman Dina (Putri Marino), has no idea about her dad&apos;s other &apos;children&apos;.\n\nThree years later, Petrus is murdered, and Dina investigates, discovering her father&apos;s secret...\n\nThe comedy kicks in when Dina encounters her &apos;brothers and sister&apos;, who have now retired from the killing business, and the film suffers for it, the silliness being more irritating than funny.

Worse it shows a new Coppola that I&apos;ll be avoiding in the future. I say this as someone who can get excited for a project like this, one that embraces youth without sugarcoating the folly and pretensions, that brings a genuine curiosity to a vibrant world—in short something like Spring Breakers that in the thuggish lifestyle finds room for reflection.\n\nThis is a superficial look at superficial people, and I mean superficial in what Coppola sees of them. For what it&apos;s worth she decided to delve into these lives, apparently inspired by real events. The real events are not a concern here, they are always a springboard for our cinematic journey. She decided to bring these people into focus for us to see, at least so far as she could see into them. \n\nAnd what does she see? A flaky, rootless youth that has not worked to create its world, that emptily covets expensive trinkets and finds them by merely walking through the door and grabbing stuff. This isn&apos;t just about these four individuals who sneak into celebrities&apos; homes, it is a broader look at instagram culture. Naturally.\n\nWhat&apos;s worse is that Coppola has not found some inner space where souls feebly try to know each other and participate, how stealing fabrics can be a search for the identity of what to wrap around self. I&apos;m not saying they should have been shown as troubled romantics. Looking at my youth I recognize a lot of superficial obsessions with unimportant things, it comes with being young and just throwing yourself at this or that current, but I also recognize that as inadvertent part of a larger floating sense of everything feeling doable and airy, which is the essence of youthfulness.\n\nIt&apos;s what Korine brings to Spring Breakers and feels transcendent, the free wandering of mind.\n\nCoppola tries to show some of that, for instance in the scenes of partying where time ecstatically slows, but is constantly bogged down by the surly need to press on with their neuroses and vacant desires. She adopts a catty and empty look because in her eyes they are merely catty and empty people. There&apos;s too much judgement here and not enough intuitive understanding of subtler pulls.\n\nIn the future I expect her to be torn to shreds for this one film. How is it that her Marie Antoinette, obviously modeled after her own self, can be shown wistfully in spite of the sheltered privilege as a quietly suffering soul but not these girls?

Can totally understand the appeal and award attention with it being one of the most deserving nominees in generally one of recent years&apos; better award seasons, &apos;The Breadwinner&apos; is a stunning and truly accomplished film, so much more than entertainment. It is one of the year&apos;s most emotional and unique films and no other film has moved me as much as &apos;The Breadwinner&apos; did in some time now.\n\nFor one thing, &apos;The Breadwinner&apos; looks stunning. Being rich in detail and atmospheric, as well as beautifully drawn. The ambient sound has much authenticity, which thrills and makes one feel they are there in the setting without being intrusive. The writing is genuine and sincere, like the rest of the film, with an unfussy and never dumbed down or preachy approach to facing harsh realities and adversity in a way that feels realistic.\n\nLoved the storytelling and really along with the emotion it is &apos;The Breadwinner&apos;s&apos; biggest strengths. It is always captivating, has a lot of emotional impact, made me feel and has something that not many films this year had, soul. \n\nIt tackles serious and heavy themes that one does not usually see in an animated film and deals with them gently and sincerely yet with full impact. It is intelligent and in some ways educational, and what could have easily been heavy-handed isn&apos;t (especially the political element). The characterisation has depth and interest, with a lead character that is instantly relatable due to her spirit, innocence and willpower.

It was directed by Stacy Title, and written by Jonathan Penner (of TV&apos;s &apos;SURVIVOR&apos; fame). The script is based on a chapter of the 2005 book &apos;The President&apos;s Vampire&apos;, titled &apos;The Bridge to Body Island&apos; (by Robert Damon Schneck). The film stars Douglas Smith, Cressida Bonas, Lucien Laviscount, Jenna Kanell, Michael Trucco, Carrie-Ann Moss, Leigh Whannell, Erica Tremblay, Cleo King, Faye Dunaway and Doug Jones (as The Bye Bye Man). It&apos;s received mostly negative reviews from critics, and fans alike, but it&apos;s done really well at the Box Office (so far). I thought it was OK.\n\nThree college students (Smith, Bonas and Laviscount) move into an old house, near campus. Once there, they learn about a supernatural entity called The Bye Bye Man (Jones). They also discover that the Bye Bye Man can possess anyone who says or thinks it&apos;s name (and make them do horrible things). In order to try and stop the creature, they investigate it&apos;s origins. While doing so, they desperately try to stop others from learning about it. They also frantically try not to kill each other, in the process either.\n\nThe movie is a great concept for a horror flick, and The Bye Bye Man is definitely a frighteningly memorable slasher film villain. I&apos;d like to see a sequel, or maybe more, and hopefully the potential franchise keeps getting better. Penner&apos;s script isn&apos;t bad though (he also plays a small part in the film), and Title&apos;s direction is decent as well. I also can&apos;t believe the producers got such an awesome cast for this (Whannell, Moss, Dunaway, Jones!).

Dealing with a sobering yet equally farcical story that lasts over many years, the film is full of honest emotion, and somehow manages to deliver a sprawling story of a lifetime in a very short space of time.\n\nAnd that&apos;s where I want to start, because while there&apos;s a lot about The Climb that&apos;s really impressive, the way that it feels almost like an epic is incredible. Running for less than 100 minutes, most films would struggle to tell a more contained story, let alone one that spans such a long timeframe.\n\nHowever, as it moves through the years in impressively organic fashion, The Climb is able to bring a greater scale to its story, and as such brings greater stakes and significance to the table as well. The ups and downs of Mike and Kyle&apos;s friendship aren&apos;t just a blip in time, but a major part of their entire lives.\n\nAlong with the two fantastic lead performances and excellent writing, you really feel like you know these two characters inside out, and though their relationship may be far from perfect as time goes by, you sympathise strongly with both of them from beginning to end.\n\nAnother impressive characteristic of The Climb is its minimalist style. It&apos;s not obnoxiously minimalist like many mumblecore movies, but it&apos;s able to tell a sprawling story of a lifetime without ever following generic tropes of the epic format.\n\nThe film is able to pack its story into such a concise runtime because of the way it uses organic dialogue to such great effect throughout. As we jump through time between different vignettes, the screenplay explains what has happened in the last few years or however long with just a couple of words offhand from a character that feels entirely natural to the situation at hand.\n\nThere&apos;s no clunky exposition or drawn-out narration, but rather succinct and brilliantly organic dialogue that helps what could have been a regularly abrupt series of time shifts flow so nicely.\n\nThat structural flow is also helped by the movie&apos;s camerawork, which pulls the Birdman trick of using long, long, long takes where the camera flies around the characters for minutes on end without a single cut.\n\nThe whole movie isn&apos;t a one-shot story like Birdman, but each of its vignettes are more or less made up of a main single shot that lasts for a long time. However, in tandem with its elegant screenplay and flowing structure, that visual style works really nicely, and only adds to the film&apos;s brilliantly organic nature.\n\nThe screenplay itself is both funny and touching, with humour that made me laugh on a consistent basis, but that never cheapened the real depth and gravity of the story being told here.\n\nThe movie looks at the story of a toxic friendship as a sobering farce, with the almost unrelenting nature of Mike&apos;s terrible behaviour becoming so bad that it&apos;s actually funny. And yet, even when the story seems to be beating you over the head with a rather heavy dose of dark humour, there&apos;s a really touching, positive message at its core.\n\nFinishing on a wonderful high note, The Climb proves that you sometimes have to go through the worst of times to end up in the right place, and its sprawling feel makes that resonate all the more strongly. With excellent performances, gorgeous cinematography, an intelligent and funny screenplay and a brilliantly organic style, it&apos;s an undeniably captivating movie which always has its heart in the right place.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",3.35,R,"['Comedy', 'Drama']",2020-11-13,"male nudity,male bonding,male friendship,male rear nudity,penis",PT1H38M,"[{'name': 'Kyle Marvin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5568803/'}, {'name': 'Michael Angelo Covino', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3511834/'}, {'name': 'Gayle Rankin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4587360/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Angelo Covino', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3511834/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Angelo Covino', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3511834/'}, {'name': 'Kyle Marvin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5568803/'}]",3.65,0.0

The conjuring 2 still holds its roots of suspense and terror with it&apos;s reliance on silent atmosphere and subtle Paceing, While still delivering sort of a seclusive atmosphere even though this is being set in a more populated area. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga again give a great performance as the warrens you start to get more in depth into their characters and their relationship to this film. Lorraine is having visions involving Ed and she&apos;s beginning to feel that they should probably give up this life in order to save their. You really understand the pain that she&apos;s feeling, as they try to bring the family closer together speaking highly on one another. It&apos;s because of these two performances you get more of a strong bond between these characters. As for the first the family themselves what screen time The other kids have they get decent performances as does Frances O&apos;Connor as Peggy. However the best performance the one who really goes to Madison wolf as Janet one of the main children believed to be possessed. You&apos;re given plenty indication that this is a child that&apos;s pretty much depressed and just feel like a target. The way she gives a performance with her face along with ther body language when she possessed, she just does a good job. Another aspect of the movie is that it tries to give is more of a real world perspective as sort of a theme with others claiming the family trying to bank in on the whole claim as Hoax and that really Janet is the problem. Unlike the first one where they eventually explained Bathsheba this movie doesn&apos;t explain as much and leave everybody in a shadow of a doubt. You know there&apos;s something going on here but you don&apos;t exactly know what it gives sort of a mystery. What really build help build the world of these movies is that they don&apos;t try to play it off as just a movie they played real serious which Really helps immerse the audience into the Film. The conjuring two as a decent follow up a special film that keeps you curious in what is the come next.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.65,R,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",2016-06-10,"haunted house,second part,house,single mother,demonic possession",PT2H14M,"[{'name': 'Vera Farmiga', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267812/'}, {'name': 'Patrick Wilson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0933940/'}, {'name': 'Madison Wolfe', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4068901/'}]","[{'name': 'James Wan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1490123/'}]","[{'name': 'Chad Hayes', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370937/'}, {'name': 'Carey W.

Soon Einar is going around as the Lili character and soon decides that he&apos;s a woman on the inside.\n\nTHE DANISH GIRL is another beautiful looking film from Tom Hooper, the director best known for his Oscar-winner THE KING&apos;S SPEECH. Like that film the director has no problem with the visual look of the film and Hooper certainly knows how to put you in the period setting. It also doesn&apos;t hurt that we&apos;ve got some excellent performances and a rather interesting and conflicted love story.\n\nI think the real draw here are the performances with Redmayne once again delivering a remarkable piece of work just a year after his Oscar win for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. A lot of actors have played male/female characters to perfection. In my mind the greatest was Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE but that there was a comedy whereas this here certainly isn&apos;t. It was really remarkable seeing how well Redmayne played both the male and female character and he was certainly believable as both. Whenever the Lili character was on screen you really did feel as if you were watching an actress and not just a man playing a female. Vikander is also excellent as the woman who finds the man she love slowly turning into someone else.\n\nThe film features some beautiful cinematography, a great music score and I also thought the screenplay was very good. The story itself drags a tad bit during the first portion but I think it asks a lot of really good questions about what love is and of course what one feels about who they really are. I thought the flow of the film was quite good and there&apos;s no question that it nails the costume design and sets.

The first hour was uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to the plutocracy we see all around us today. \n\nThe performances were outstanding. I am not sure where Bria Vinaite has been hiding, but she was astonishing as the mom, Hailey. Her daughter and all of the other kids were great, and their interactions, behavior, dialogue and play was hysterical. Then it kind of morphed into a more serious story, that was credible, and powerful. Willem Dafoe was his usual masterful self, and played a very real, very likable guy. A tough guy with a heart of gold. \n\nI highly recommend this film. Not for everyone. Several people walked out during the film. My presumption was that they either thought the film focused too much time on the kids, or they were living in a state of denial, like so many Americans these days, pretending that this huge underclass does not exist.

However, by the time the credits rolled, I felt I didn&apos;t learn very much. At all.\n\nEarly reviews critiqued this film for focusing too much on Thatcher in her later years, stricken with dementia. This is couldn&apos;t be any more true. In a very clichéd, seen-it-all-before fashion, Thatcher&apos;s life is rolled out in fragmented segments as an older Thatcher reminisces with the ghost of her late husband, played by Jim Broadbent.\n\nYes, The Iron Lady is primarily portrayed as a woman who speaks with a hallucination of her husband, thus making her flashbacks seem less like fact and more like fanciful bit memories of a crazy person. Very short, sporadic flashbacks that don&apos;t offer up much detail, nuance or information and insight into the woman herself. It was more like looking through a flashback of headlines that lead you to skim through the article rather than reading it.\n\nAnd such a delivery is a real disservice not just to an audience craving some real glimpse into the life of the first female leader of the Western world, but to both Thatcher and Meryl Streep themselves, whose riveting performance is lost in a film with no real direction, focus or substance.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Golden-Globe-nominated Streep is a lock for her seventeenth Oscar nomination, as her transformation into the titular woman of iron is extraordinary.

Co-written and directed by former Gravity Falls writer Mike Rianda, the film was initially set to come out in September of 2020, but due to COVID restrictions, it was eventually delayed until the end of April and released on Netflix. Now that the world is finally ready to see the Mitchells unleashed, just how much was the wait worth it in the end?\n\nThe film follows the Mitchells, a dysfunctional family with an aspiring filmmaker daughter named Katie and a down to earth father named Rick that fail to see eye to eye from when they were younger. While attempting to rekindle their relationship on Katie&apos;s trip to college, the whole family winds up having to save Earth from a robot uprising while on a road trip. Now based on that bizarre premise, it would seem like we have a case of two different movies clashing together. However, the otherwise routine storyline of a family overcoming their differences is ultimately saved and even elevated by this other arc, because the movie&apos;s biggest theme lies in how overly dependent people have become to technology nowadays. While it is wonderful just how much the world has advanced in adapting to technological innovation, including animated features, one must be careful to not take it for granted. Sometimes, all it takes is just one person to deem an AI obsolete for the whole world to fall under chaos; that is just how much the reliance on technology has grown in humanity, both for better and worse.\n\nAs for the Mitchells story arc, like I mentioned before, it is admittedly a fairly standard plot about a parent and offspring needing to overcome their differences to connect again. However, to the film&apos;s credit, the characters themselves range from charmingly hysterical to surprisingly relatable. Katie represents the adorkably creative artist in many of today&apos;s generation, Rick is a good hearted albeit overly indulgent maniac of a dad trying to figure out today&apos;s youth, Linda is an overly perfectionist mother that demands the family be functional even at her most calm, and Katie&apos;s little brother Aaron might be the most hilarious dinosaur obsessed squirt since Calvin from Calvin & Hobbes (and their bug eyed potato dog Monchi is the cherry on top). This whole family of eccentric weirdos drive the film forward, especially compared to their allies and enemies, be it evil robots or family rivals. Not to mention, the whole cast clearly had a blast in their roles, especially Abbi Jacobson and Danny McBride being the most authentic as a quirky albeit frustrated teen and an overly impulsive father.\n\nOut of all the animated features to be released this year right now, this film might have the most unique visuals and art direction yet. In addition to Lindsey Olivares&apos; stylized character designs translating seamlessly in the SPA renderfarm, the animators did the most in exercising their acting chops to make the characters move like real people yet still feel appropriately exaggerated. The backgrounds are also a neat reflection of how the United States would look if it went from a neat colorful environment to a post apocalyptic sci-fi nightmare, with the right amount of special effects, color gradients and shadows to go along with the world-building. There are even nice additional 2D animated chunks that are either used in lieu of exposition or cute little add ons to the suspense in a given scene. The only genuine criticism to give the visuals is that sometimes those gimmicky effects and filters can be a little too frequent and even jarring, especially when some of the movie&apos;s humor is overly reliant on modern internet culture. Let&apos;s just say some of the filters could come off as jump scares.\n\nI can&apos;t think of a better energetic romp of a film for the whole family to enjoy as much as this one. Not only is The Mitchells vs. The Machines an eye-catching twist on the family road dramedy genre, but it might be the most fun animated film released in a while. If Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation keep up this track record of enjoyable thrill rides disguised as innovative experiments, then there&apos;s no telling what the future holds for moviegoers. If you haven&apos;t seen the film yet, go on your Netflix account and give it a go. There&apos;s never been a better time to connect with your love of movies than now.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}",3.8,SU,"['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure']",2021-04-30,"robot,road trip,dog,furby,family road trip",PT1H54M,"[{'name': 'Abbi Jacobson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3434305/'}, {'name': 'Danny McBride', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1144419/'}, {'name': 'Maya Rudolph', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748973/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Rianda', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5106831/'}, {'name': 'Jeff Rowe', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6676487/'}]","[{'name': 'Michael Rianda', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5106831/'}, {'name': 'Jeff Rowe', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6676487/'}, {'name': 'Peter Szilagyi', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1667980/'}]",0.0,0.0

Somehow, audiences and critics are getting more demanding and expect brainier and tighter story lines, but it&apos;s still plenty of fun to see a light, crazy ride like this... One where the hero is besieged by unfortunate circumstances and must one way or another succeed or die. With the help of Haggis&apos; strong direction and a very good performance by Crow, we&apos;re treated to two hours of action, where one doesn&apos;t have to do a lot of thinking, just watching Crowe dodge bullet after bullet and cheer him along to the nail-biting end.\n\nThe main reason the film works is Crowe gives it his best, scene after scene his eyes tells us his character is committed to his family, and he will stand by them no matter what. There is very little background given to us, except for an opening scene which serves the purpose of planting the seed of doubt in our minds, but this only helps fuel the sense of despair and sadness that threatens to destroy this family.\n\nLittle by little, we follow Crowe&apos;s teacher, as he races against the clock to help his wife, and soon enough, he is dealing with the scum of society and an increasingly suspicious police force. Relationships with his family are tense at best, and any new relationships are threatened his wife&apos;s past. It&apos;s the attention to this intimate and personal moments that makes us care for him, even when he makes a couple of disturbing moves.\n\nOne thing you won&apos;t be is bored, as the circle tightens, so that his quest might not get his desired results.

The film&apos;s many fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and flawlessly executed, Tjahanto&apos;s breath-taking direction employing shooting techniques that are guaranteed to astound, although it&apos;s the sheer quantity of blood and guts that really impresses.\n\nThe film stars Joe Taslim as triad member Ito, who seeks redemption for all the terrible things that he has done by saving a young girl, Reina (Asha Kenyeri Bermudez), from his hit squad. Having gunned down his own men and escaped with the girl, Ito finds himself targeted by the triad&apos;s top killers, who include Raid star Iko Uwais as his old pal Arian, Julie Estelle (The Raid 2&apos;s Hammer Girl) as a motorcycle-riding assassin, and a pair of lesbian hit-women: Elena (Hannah Al Rashid), who is armed with a kukri knife, and Alma (Dian Sastrowardoyo), who wields a whirling wire weapon.\n\nAs Ito, aided by his loyal friends Bobby (Zack Lee), Fatih (Abimana Aryasatya) and Wisnu (Dimas Anggara), battles to protect Reina, viewers are treated to all manner of graphic violence: bodies are beaten and mutilated, necks are slashed, and bones are broken. A man is hung on a meathook, someone is machine gunned in the face, and a grenade rips another poor bloke to pieces. There&apos;s a shotgun blast to the foot, a knife through the neck, a severed hand, an evisceration, pool balls to the skull, a hook in the crotch, a utility knife in the mouth (and through the cheek), and more bullet hits and stabbings than I can recall.

Apt acting and sensational ballet dancing excel and make this something more memorable than the premise might suggest. Any Disney fans will want to check this out. The story follows young Clara (Mackenzie Foy) as she recovers from her mother&apos;s death. However, a spark of hope lightens Clara after seeing her late mother&apos;s parting gift of a box with a hidden key. This key belongs to a parallel world, unlike anything, to which Clara must travel to obtain the key. With the help of budding soldier Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), Clara learns of all obstacles that await, especially in the form of the menacing Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), leader of the Fourth Realm. Most importantly is a looming war that could preside over the three Realms that are at peace - Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets and are threatened by the Fourth Realm. In the three Realms resides Sugar Plum (Kiera Knightley) who is on same page as Clara and braves her up for the Fourth Realm as the fate of the Realms and her mother&apos;s dying wish relies on it.\n\nMackenzie Foy, as Clara, well presents her character&apos;s central struggle to find her inner place amidst all the tragedy, while also being hopeful and cheerful. The end result of this character development is a joy to watch and most definitely the movie&apos;s best subplot, amongst all the other slumberous ones. Kiera Knightley, as Sugar Plum Fairy, regales with well-written comedic relief, but the timing of her intervention seems quite random and very over-the-top at times. Regardless, children, most of all, will find enjoyment with all the youthful energy. Jayden Fowora-Knight, as Philip, is my favorite character, despite this being only the second film he has appeared in. His charm and braveness add a relentless vigor to the character that never gets old. Helen Mirren, as Mother Ginger, likewise shines, despite her character suffering from a lack of screen time and character development. With what she is given, she shines with the menacing undertones that could mean good under the entire demeanor. Also, Misty Copeland&apos;s cameo is full of entertainment with her ballet proficiency bringing a certain something to the stage without feeling like a forced addition. Instead, it feels more like a celebration of the Nutcracker&apos;s roots and remains my favorite scene.\n\nLasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston expertly direct the visual flair with clear attention to every nook and cranny of the special effects and sound design. Despite this, the movie has flaws coming from the lack of a compelling story line, aside from Clara&apos;s inner struggles. Everything feels introduced way too quickly and without clear meaning. This leaves the movie feeling rather inconsequential and just an excuse to put the Nutcracker on the live screen. Still, the movie delivers an amazing awe to each scene&apos;s production.\n\nThe message of the movie is to never lose yourself in sorrow and always connect with your family and friends during times of grief. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18.\n\nReviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Operative is one of those slow spy thrillers, it takes its time to build the characters and attempts are made to connect audiences to Diane Kruger&apos;s character. However the actual presentation of the story has some real pacing issues where I lost the plot many times. I get that this is meant to be a character driven film. But film makers such as Polanski (Chinatown) and Sydney Pollack (Three Days of the Condor) have shown that the plot can take a backseat for characters. But there was still considerable amount of strings being pulled in the background to make it work. The stories were complex because there were many details that need to be uncovered. The Operative is convoluted because there is very little within the story and therefore the film makers try to hide that by dragging scenes out. By having scenes that are completely pointless. Diane Kruger is an extremely talented actress and this may actually be her best performance of her career. Her character is relatable to audiences but mysterious for them to ask the question who she really is. The rest of the cast feels rather wasted with other players including Martin Freeman, pop in and out of the picture. The movie on a technical level is competent but nothing shows of a unique vision. This makes The Operative feel like a generic spy caper that isn&apos;t even exciting.

Blue Skies and Sunshine Guaranteed!', 'reviewBody': 'The Princess and the Frog is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It marks Walt Disney Animation Studio&apos;s return to 2D animation, to recapture the era of amazing movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast – timeless tales that have reached audiences across the world. However, unlike these previous movies, The Princess and the Frog does something new. It&apos;s an updated take on the classic fairy tale, set in Jazzy New Orleans filled with witch doctors, Maldonian princes, southern lovesick daughters, Jazz playing alligators and even Cajun fireflies! In the midst of all this jazz is Disney&apos;s first black princess, Tiana, and her story.\n\nTiana is a young girl who wants to follow her father&apos;s dream and open up her very own restaurant. She works hard, never taking a chance on Prince Charming to sweep her off her feet - she is a realist Disney &apos;princess&apos; - and that makes her stand apart from the rest. And speaking of breaking from tradition, Prince Naveen is another fresh take on the classic Disney prince. He gets a fair amount of screen time and shows us that princes are more than just stuffy suits. The pair has great chemistry as frogs and their intertwining journey is full of laughs and heart tingling moments sprinkled with some good old Disney magic. Disney Animation Studios has pulled it off again; they have conjured up something fresh and new and have made it entertaining. Perhaps we can expect greater things for the future because this is a pretty good start.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of this musical is, of course, the music! Randy Newman has provided an array of songs, from bouncy piano songs to gospel to Broadway. There is no one single style of music and Newman serves up a diverse platter accompanied by stunning animation. There are several songs in the movie, perhaps more than needed, but all catchy while bringing a yet another flavor to New Orleans. The downside to these songs is that they are many, short and have the task of pushing story. Their presence feels like designated intervals, sometimes jarring up moments which could have been executed wonderfully without any song.\n\nPacing and story are the main challenges The Princess and the Frog faces. Too much happens and it happens too fast. There is an engaging plot, obstacles are overcome through action and songs also push the story forward. This leaves us very little time for dwelling in scene. I personally think this is why the movie doesn&apos;t feel quite up to par with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty or The Lion King – there are very few moments which rely on deeper truths or engage with characters&apos; inner struggles and relationships. I wish the directors would have slowed down and let us have a bit more interaction rather than relying on action and songs to advance plot. Also, some crucial events relied on coincidence when they could&apos;ve been worked into the plot more skillfully. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Princess and the Frog still delivers an entertaining story.\n\nPersonally, I think the darker a Disney film is, the more interesting it will be. It lends a sense of reality and tells me that despite its catchy songs and humor, the movie takes itself seriously. Princess and the Frog definitely takes itself seriously. One of the main reasons I wanted to see this film was because of Dr. Facilier. He makes the film tastefully dark and shows us that even a Disney story can chill audiences. The voodoo world is intoxicating, full of intrigue and Facilier&apos;s theme song tells us he is a villain with style rivaling the likes of Jafar or Scar. However, unlike the previous villains, Facillier doesn&apos;t constantly trump the heroes after his first appearance. Villains kind of get a backseat in the movie - some people might not like this so beware! \n\nDespite its darker side, the movie is surprisingly funny and downright hilarious. Like the old classics, the movie is timeless in a way. It doesn&apos;t reference any modern pop culture. There are lots of things that made audiences laugh, some more than others. There is no one type of humor strung throughout the whole film. Without giving anything away, I would also like to say the humor gets pretty risqué at times but it&apos;s welcoming because it tells us Disney is not excluding anyone from the audience. \n\nThere are some very spectacular moments of animation in this film. The characters are drawn in the 90&apos;s classic Disney style and don&apos;t have extremely stylized or exaggerated features that we&apos;ve seen in later works like Emperor&apos;s New groove or Home on the Range. This blast from the past is a breath of fresh air. 2D animation is here to stay.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",3.55,G,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']",2010-01-06,"prince,frog,restaurant,new orleans jazz,friendship between girls",PT1H37M,"[{'name': 'Anika Noni Rose', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741242/'}, {'name': 'Keith David', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/'}, {'name': 'Oprah Winfrey', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001856/'}]","[{'name': 'Ron Clements', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166256/'}, {'name': 'John Musker', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615780/'}]","[{'name': 'Ron Clements', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166256/'}, {'name': 'John Musker', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615780/'}, {'name': 'Greg Erb', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258627/'}]",3.7,4.25

It stars &apos;GOSSIP GIRL&apos;s Leighton Meester as the psycho student and Minka Kelly as the good girl. The film is directed by Christian E. Christiansen and written by first time writer Sonny Mallhi. It&apos;s mildly amusing at times but for the most part it&apos;s routine and devoid of thrills or any real action.\n\nKelly plays Sara Matthews and Meester plays Rebecca Evans. When the two first meet in the dorm room they&apos;ve both been given they immediately hit it off. What Sara doesn&apos;t realize is that she&apos;s made too much of an impression on Rebecca and she quickly becomes obsessed with her. Sara is also troubled by an ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter) who keeps calling but has met a new love interest in drummer Stephen Morterelli (Cam Gigandet). This doesn&apos;t sit well with Rebecca who wants Sara all to herself. Her obsession turns to creepy and dangerous really fast.\n\nThe film is very light on thrills and violence (for a thriller). The first two thirds of the film actually play out more like a depressing character study drama leaving the viewer feeling more sorry for Rebecca than afraid of her but then of course the end turns to routine third act &apos;B&apos; movie trash and we finally get some action. Meester is somewhat good as the troubled student and Kelly looks beautiful but for the most part the movie has no real acting to speak of. The dialogue is weak and scares and thrills, like I said, are nearly nonexistent. The movie fails on almost every count but it&apos;s still mildly amusing.

The plot is nothing stunning but neither is it entirely unbelievable. Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is a big time con-artist/thief who operates to further his own financial position, charm some very attractive ladies and buy himself a Volvo that actually looks good. An ambitious Russian oil magnate hires him to steal a formula off a gorgeous nuclear physicist. They fall in love and Templar turns from thief into hero. I don&apos;t think this movie claims to be anything life-changing but it&apos;s good fun if taken lightly. Kilmer has a good turn as Templar and his various disguises and pranks along with some bungling by a few hapless Scotland Yard detectives provide a few laughs. The action is great fun and backed by the Chemical Brothers and Underworld. The romance between Elisabeth Shue&apos;s character and Kilmer&apos;s isn&apos;t bad either, they&apos;re both convincing in their own way and there are some nice moments for sentimental folk like me. The Saint is perfect for a quiet night with the boys, beers and some gawking at Elisabeth Shue, it&apos;s bad not to watch with that someone special either.\n\nCheers\n\nTim', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': None, 'bestRating': None, 'ratingValue': None}}",3.1,PG-13,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Romance']",1997-04-04,"snow adventure,cold fusion,knights templar,cranberry,close up of eyes",PT1H56M,"[{'name': 'Val Kilmer', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174/'}, {'name': 'Elisabeth Shue', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000223/'}, {'name': 'Rade Serbedzija', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784884/'}]","[{'name': 'Phillip Noyce', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637518/'}]","[{'name': 'Leslie Charteris', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0153546/'}, {'name': 'Jonathan Hensleigh', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378144/'}, {'name': 'Wesley Strick', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834338/'}]",1.9,0.0

When Smurfette(Katy Perry) assumes that the rest of the Smurfs have forgotten her birthday, she&apos;s very depressed & wanders off alone. She thinks that she&apos;s not a true blue Smurf as she was originally a Naughty created by the evil wizard, Gargamel(Hank Azaria). Meanwhile Gargamel hatches an evil plot to kidnap Smurfette & get her to tell the formula to turn two of his Naughties, Vexy(Christina Ricci) & Hackus(J.B Smoove) into real Smurfs. Vexy enters the portal to Smurf village, kidnaps Smurfette & takes her back to Earth. Now,it is up to Papa(Jonathan Winters), Grouchy(George Lopez), Clumsy(Anton Yelchin) & Vanity(John Oliver) to rescue Smurfette from Gargamel before he coerces her to give him the formula. The Smurfs seek the help of their friends, Patrick(Neil Patrick Harris) his wife, Grace(Jayma Mays) & Patrick&apos;s step-dad Victor(Brendan Gleeson). \n\nThe Smurfs 2 was lots of fun! I can&apos;t believe it has such a low rating on IMDb. It&apos;s not supposed to be the best film ever. It&apos;s just a cute movie about love, friendship, the importance of family & how they will always be by your side. Looking at the morals the film teaches you, it&apos;s a perfect weekend outing with your family & a perfect popcorn movie for everyone who wants to watch it alone. The fusion between live-action & animation is enchanting. The 3D is flawless. The entire movie is filled with eye popping 3D effects. The best scene in the film for me is when, Smurfette & the Naughties are flying around Paris. Mind blowing visual effects & animation. Hank Azaria is the standout performer as the bumbling wizard, Gargamel. Neil Patrick Harris is great as Patrick. Jayma Mays is impressive as Grace. Brendan Gleeson is hilarious as Victor. Katy Perry, Christina Ricci, Jonathan Winters, Anton Yelchin, George Lopez, John Oliver & J.B Smoove are perfect as Smurfette, Vexy, Papa, Clumsy, Grouchy, Vanity & Hackus respectively. The gags are a little childish but, it is a comedy for kids, not adults.

Makes the whole concept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting (something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a strong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this movie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped in his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking&apos;s surprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but because I expected his condition would make it hard to express any emotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking on camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).\n\nThis movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a relationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks like Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as depressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex relationship taking it&apos;s toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.\n\nIf your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that&apos;s not what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the world of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it out for Hawking.

This said, I am indifferent to the franchise. As far as the movies, I still think, coming from someone whose knowledge of the books only comes from my sister being a fan and me reading a chapter of one and putting it down, that the best is Eclipse(not saying much) and New Moon the worst. But that is not a consolation really. Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is not quite among the worst of the year and nowhere near among the worst ever, however it suffers from some major problems that I will get to later in the review. \n\nSo what was it that got me seeing Breaking Dawn: Part 1 in the first place? The answer was its director, Bill Condon. I am familiar with his previous films and find him a promising director and writer, finding his films well written, observed and acted. Gods and Monsters is amazing and one of my favourites, Kinsey was interesting and Dreamgirls elevated by the soundtrack and cast was quite decent. Did Condon do a good job directing? For me, I am not sure. I&apos;d say of the four Twilight movies so far Breaking Dawn: Part 1 has the most cinematic feel to it, on the other hand there is not much here that made Condon&apos;s previous films so good and I&apos;d go as far to say it is the film of his that engaged me the least.\n\nAre there any redeeming qualities to this instalment? I think so actually. Although there are moments of sloppy editing, I did like the look of the film. At some points it was quite Gothic, and at others it had either an evergreen or autumnal feel to it. The scenery often does look stunning, the effects are okay I guess and the cinematography especially with the close-ups of the back of the wedding dress and the final shot is some of the best of the franchise in my opinion.I also liked Carter Burwell&apos;s score. I like Burwell a lot, his music has a hypnotic and quite hauntingly beautiful quality to it. For my tastes though some of the pop tunes are on the insipid side, however the score itself was pleasant with a lot of what I like about Burwell evident.\n\nMuch has been said about the sex scene. In all honesty I was expecting it to be of hilariously cheesy quality, but somehow Condon brought a little more subtlety than I was expecting. The last thirty minutes was perhaps the most exciting Breaking Dawn: Part 1 got, as some of does have purpose and intensity, which was something that the first half of the film did not have.There are also two good performances, Billy Burke and Michael Sheen, the latter being another point of interest. Burke as always is amusing with some of the better lines of the film(though is that saying much do you think?), while Sheen, ever the great actor, adopts a menace and magnetism as Aro without overdoing it too much. Ashley Greene is also quite good, if not great.\n\nI have to say I still don&apos;t think much of the acting of the central trio. Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless. It doesn&apos;t help though that Bella is a rather dull character.Robert Pattinson has more to do than he did in New Moon and is less hammy than in the first film(the looking into the camera moments brought moments of unintentional laughter when I first went to see Twilight when it came out). As a matter of fact this is perhaps his best performance of the series and he is certainly the best of the central trio, but like Stewart some of the line delivery could&apos;ve been more inspired.\n\nTaylor Lautner on the other hand is getting worse and worse. He is hunky to be sure, but does that alone make you a good actor? Not to me. I will give credit and say he is better than he was in this year&apos;s Abduction, where both the film and performance were awful, but the more dramatic moments from him felt forced and overplayed, and throughout there was a very stilted nature about him. A lot of the problem is to do with the writing. The dialogue in the Twilight franchise never was particularly good, saying this though in terms of written quality this is Twilight at its most banal, its most clunky and its most cheesy. The characters are clichéd and underdeveloped too, and at the end of the day you don&apos;t care for anybody. Oh, and the talking wolves were poorly done and unintentionally funny.\n\nThe story is very bland and unengaging, not to mention thin structurally and in content. The whole of the first half reads little more than ponderous melodrama. Was the wedding lavish? Yes it was. But it was also plodding and over-extended. The second half fares better, still with the clunky dialogue, uneven acting and cheesy, underdeveloped plot points and characterisations, but as I said the last thirty minutes or so serves as the highlight of the film. But for me what killed the film was the pace. Mind you, I have seen movies with slow pacing, but they are often paced deliberately and with strong meanings, great acting and dialogue and identifiable characters. With little of that here, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 not only is dull and plodding but also uninteresting and without bite.\n\nOverall, despite my admiration for Condon and Sheen, this didn&apos;t work. The ending is highly suggestive of a continuation, which I understand is happening. If so, I do hope it will be better than this. 4/10 Bethany Cox', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 4}}",2.45,16+,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",2011-11-18,"wedding,marriage,pregnancy,vampire,age difference",PT1H57M,"[{'name': 'Kristen Stewart', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576/'}, {'name': 'Robert Pattinson', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1500155/'}, {'name': 'Taylor Lautner', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1210124/'}]","[{'name': 'Bill Condon', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0174374/'}]","[{'name': 'Melissa Rosenberg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742279/'}, {'name': 'Stephenie Meyer', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2769412/'}]",0.0,0.0

It is all shown in cartoonish manner, but if you or your kids have any history with any of the previously mention topics, this is not something I would consider a safe or fun watch. There&apos;s also some slightly creepy imagery, mostly coming from the young twins.

True, it does have some anime influence (like slim bodies and expressive eyes) but most contemporary cartoons have that anyway.\n\nIn short, this movie is about a teenage Thor embarking on a quest to prove his manhood to his father, who still considers him immature. With the aid of his brother Loki and the Warriors Three he travels through different realms to complete his quest.\n\nWhat I liked in this film was that it showed a different, refreshing perspective on Thor and Loki&apos;s relationship. In this film we actually see Loki as a caring brother who is a loyal Asgardian. He and Thor share a special bond, trust each other and, when times get tough, provide each other with support. Seeing this just makes it even more heartbreaking as the viewers know that in the future these two would become mortal enemies.\n\nSome dialogues were actually funny without relying on simple humor - even giving room to a bit adult humor when it came to Fandral. There is romance (concerning both brothers), and there are notable number of dark scenes and dialogues which concentrate on the topics of genocide (yes, genocide!) and character death. Unlike most children&apos;s cartoons nowadays, it has quite a few mature themes which adults may like.\n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant surprise and more mature than I expected.

Unfortunately, a drawn out final third, featuring some clumsy action scenes and the occasional unintentionally funny moment, ultimately drains the movie of some of its power.\n\nBeautiful Swedish star Christina Lindberg plays Madeleine, a young mute woman who is kidnapped, hooked on heroin, and then forced to work as a prostitute. After clawing her first customer in the face, she is punished by Tony, her sadistic captor, who, in a particularly nasty scene, uses a scalpel to blind her in one eye (this realistic moment was reputedly achieved with the use of an actual dead body!).\n\nAfter her injury has healed, Madeleine returns to work, with an eye-patch to hide her injury, and reluctantly complies with Tony&apos;s demands, sexually satisfying a variety of sleazy clients (bonus sleaze points are awarded here for inter-cutting graphic penetration shots with those of Ms. Lindberg, to make it appear as though she took part in the adult action).\n\nAs a reward for her good behaviour, Madeleine is given two wraps of heroin a day, a percentage of her takings, and Monday&apos;s off (a pension plan is not offered!).\n\nHowever, after the suspicious disappearance of her friend, fellow &apos;hooker&apos; Sally (who vanishes, leaving behind a blood-soaked bed), the one-eyed, smack-addicted beauty decides to get even with Tony, her abusers, and anyone else who has given her grief. She spends her free days learning self-defence, extreme driving, and marksmanship, and, once she is proficient at all three, embarks on her mission to exact bloody revenge.\n\nEverything that leads up to Madeleine eventually kicking ass is extremely well done and delightfully sordid, just as an exploitation film should be. The pace is leisurely at the beginning, but never bores, with the sex, drugs and violence all explicitly depicted. Plus, the delightful Lindberg spends a lot of her time naked.\n\nWhere Thriller does suffer is in its latter scenes, where a shotgun toting, leather-coat and eye-patch wearing Madeleine blasts her victims to kingdom come. Director Bo Arne Vibenius opts to film most of the shootings in such excruciatingly drawn-out slow motion that it&apos;s possible to pop out to the kitchen, fix a sarnie, make a pot of tea, and still get back to your seat before the body hits the floor. Imagine the gun-fights of Peckinpah or Woo at a quarter of the speed, but nowhere near as stylish, and you&apos;ll have an idea of what I mean.\n\nA final act of revenge is set in a suitably bleak environment and ends the film as one would expect—with &apos;one-eye&apos; settling the score with Tony, in a slow and painful manner.

The film is also based on the book of the same name written by Isa Hoes, who based the book on a personal experience from her life.\n\nThe couple Bastiaan (Egbert Jan Weeber) and Esther (Noortje Herlaar) are both well-known actors from the 90s. In the eyes of the world and their fans, they seem to be leading a perfect life.\n\nBehind the scenes, everything is less beautiful than it seems, because despite his success, Bastiaan suffers from a psychological depression, which is increasingly affecting his relationship with Esther and their children. Esther tries to keep Bastiaan and their family on track, but independently this takes more effort and energy than she had expected.\n\nBen Verbong tries to make a comeback as a Dutch director and scriptwriter with this film, but his last Dutch film work in which he performed these tasks was with the 1991 film The indecent woman. Unfortunately, the time between this transition falls back on this film. To see.\n\nThe story is not really clear thanks to the storytelling. In the beginning, the film shows how the film will approximately end. This can no longer be a secret for book readers or people who are familiar with the situation on which Isa Hoes has based her book. However, for people who are not familiar with this, the end of the film is given away so quickly as if they have only read the last pages of the book. As a result, the structure of the story loses some of its tension moments.\n\nThe film also focuses more on the consequences of the main character&apos;s depression, so that the cause sometimes seems a bit unclear. Due to the lack of the reasons for this cause, the main character is sometimes difficult to follow or understand. This makes the film difficult to follow at times, so it can sometimes come across as a bit long-winded. If there had been a better balance between the cause and effect of the depression, the film could have come across better. Furthermore, the film is unfortunately also filled with clichés from drama films where the depressed character is alone in the rain, for example.\n\nNoortje Herlaar tries to carry the film as the caring partner and mother, but due to separate decisions from the story, her character sometimes comes across as a bit unrealistic. Esther and Bastiaan find out about Bastiaan&apos;s depression later in the film, but they don&apos;t really take solutions for this, because Bastiaan doesn&apos;t want this. You would expect more help and control from real lovers. In emotional scenes you can sometimes also see or hear that Noortje Herlaar is crying more actingly here, so that credibility can be lost somewhat.\n\nEgbert Jan Weeber also tries to come across as someone who suffers from psychotic depression, but due to the lack of information about the cause of this depression, he is sometimes difficult to follow. When you learn a little more about the cause later in the film, it can come across as a bit weak as the real reason for his depression. After all, in addition to the depression, the main character simply has a good career history, is married with children and lives a nice life. For the reasons of his depression, you would expect that someone would be able to find the right way to avoid problems in his situations.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 4}}",3.4,0,['Drama'],2023-03-02,"female nudity,brief male frontal nudity,suicide,beach,car keys",PT1H58M,"[{'name': 'Noortje Herlaar', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3794060/'}, {'name': 'Egbert Jan Weeber', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917224/'}, {'name': 'Hanne Arendzen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4458015/'}]","[{'name': 'Ben Verbong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893676/'}]","[{'name': 'Ger Beukenkamp', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079560/'}, {'name': 'Isa Hoes', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388578/'}, {'name': 'Sytze Van Der Laan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479258/'}]",3.15,1.65

I would always say that he&apos;s one hell of a writer of dialogue, whether his work falls straight into the &apos;comedy&apos; bracket, or he dabbles in other genres, i.e. romance, science-fiction fantasy or horror. And, this time round, he&apos;s playing with the &apos;horror genre.&apos; &apos;Tusk&apos; tells the tale of a complete idiot (played delightfully by Justin Long). He&apos;s a typical product of the modern age – a podcaster with ideas way above his station. Yes, he&apos;s a little bit famous, but it appears that a little bit of fame corrupts almost as much as absolute power. He thinks he&apos;s &apos;it&apos; and lets everyone know it, whether it&apos;s his co-presenter, his doting girlfriend, or generally anyone he meets along the way.\n\nOne article on his upcoming podcast is an interview with a Canadian &apos;celebrity&apos; who&apos;s also made his name on the internet. Sadly, the &apos;celebrity&apos; in question is so traumatised with his newfound fame that he kills himself, &apos;selfishly&apos; leaving our glorious podcaster with nothing to report on while in Canada. That&apos;s when he happens upon an interesting offer in a men&apos;s restroom. It leads him to a reclusive hermit, played brilliantly by Michael Parks, who offers to tell him his life&apos;s story.\n\nThis is the fun part. The interaction between the two is just about as perfect as dialogue can be. The two exchange tales and taken on life in the setting of Park&apos;s Gothic mansion. The tension is cranked right up to the max – you know something is going to happen (something bad, obviously), but you just don&apos;t know what. This atmosphere is just electrifying when combined with the snappy dialogue. Everything is going great until...\n\n...the film just kind of switches atmosphere and great dialogue for cheap shocks. And shocks that look pretty bad rather than shocking. The second half of the film is everything that the first half isn&apos;t, i.e. cheesy. Yeah, there are a few moments of brilliance thrown in there, but, when you realise what&apos;s actually happening, you&apos;ll probably just shout, &apos;What... seriously?&apos; It just doesn&apos;t work. It feels like someone has tacked a second (lesser) film onto a good one. If I was rating the first half I&apos;d say it was awesome. If I was rating the second half I&apos;d say don&apos;t bother. Fans of Kevin Smith may like the dialogue (like I did), but most people will not really go for this on account of the sudden change in mood that doesn&apos;t fit where the film was originally heading.\n\nBest to watch this one for free however you can before you invest in actually paying for it. Some people may find the second half as shocking as it was intended. Personally, I just found it a let down and stupid.

From then on I get bombarded with negative reviews, half of which seem to be more focused on Captain Marvel then this film. But whatever, I put that aside, because whatever bias I may or may not have towards Captain Marvel, I want to judge this film on its own.\n\nSo in short I saw the whole film and I liked it. For me is wasn&apos;t the kind of comedy that made me slap my knee because I was bursting out laughing so hard (except kinda on two occasions), this is the kind of humor that made me do a double take on what weird things a characters just said, snickering a bit in disbelief. To be fair, it&apos;s kinda a weird movie.\n\nWe follow Kit, a peculiar individual to say the least, as she is pressured into adult life whilst also receiving a task that can make one of her childhood dreams come true(You can guess from the title what that is). Now with the adulthood element the film offers a &apos;fish out of water&apos; scenario for Kit, because as her name suggests, expect to see a kid in Brie Larson&apos;s performance. Most comedies star someone who doesn&apos;t want to grow up, but they&apos;re better described as immature, whereas Kit is a full-grown child. Personally I found this pretty refreshing. Brie Larson plays the role really well with such a childlike wonder and stubbornness for everything. And with naive curiosity she often asks weird questions or goes off topic because of her attention span. I found most of the other characters working really well with her, providing a bit of reality in what would otherwise be a child&apos;s fantasy.\n\nThe movie does have it&apos;s problems though. I found the middle part to be dragging a bit too much, as all the little plot points are slowly prepared for Kit&apos;s work and dream quest. And to be fair I really didn&apos;t enjoy the business plotline with Gary that much. That one fell a bit flat in characters and plot importance, providing also some of the lesser comedic moments in the film.\n\nBut it does pick up again for the third act, which was I really liked. It&apos;s the act where everything begins to clash between characters and where the film begins to pack a punch in the emotional department. The comedy is at it&apos;s best, providing possibly the film&apos;s most memorable moments, and delivers a satisfying ending to the story.\n\nIn technical aspects the movie is fine. The direction and cinematography work well, but aren&apos;t much to write home about. The production design in The Store was pretty good, otherwise also just fine. The music fits pretty well with the tone. The film kinda has a minimalistic feel to it in technical regards, to be honest.\n\nBut to wrap it up, I liked this movie. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s a fun watch with some nice little life lessons wrapped up in it. Kit&apos;s developing friendship with Mamoudou Athie especially I found really endearing. Samuel L. Jackson is gloriously weird and the parents amusingly dry. I recommend watching it for yourself. It&apos;s definitely worth checking out sometime.

I kept going back and forth on whether he was brilliant or miserable in his performance. I found myself feeling the same way I did when seeing him in Allied late last year. There are scenes when he is absolutely dialed in to the role and what&apos;s going on around him. And there are a handful of scenes where you&apos;d think someone is just reading him his lines off-screen. He&apos;s been frustratingly inconsistent these last two outings.\n\nI had no trouble deciphering the performance level of the surrounding cast, as they all came to play. From the big names of Ben Kingsley and Tilda Swinton, to still familiar names of Anthony Michael Hall and Topher Grace, I was impressed. My favorite performance would have to go to one of the smaller roles played by Lakeith Stanfield. I&apos;d seen him earlier this year in Get Out, but he had a better opportunity to shine here as an absolutely emotionally broken marine.\n\nThe first half of the film is very quirky and actually has some pretty funny lines. The second half all but abandons the comedic tone and shifts into a full fledged war drama. The end result is satisfying, but that contrast is pretty jarring. It would have been more successful to mix the paint a bit more or just choose one color.\n\nNetflix pulled out the big guns putting up $60 million for the distribution rights to the film. Later this year they are also backing a loose follow up to 2009&apos;s Moon (please see this underrated film if you haven&apos;t already) and breaking the bank with a $100 Martin Scorsese film with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in 2018. Netflix is quickly changing the game in the world of cinema. Don&apos;t be surprised to see the awards shows tweak their rules to allow for streaming content down the road.\n\nSo pop some popcorn and reserve your couch to see this film of grandiosity and failure.

Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen&apos;s junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she&apos;s to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner&apos;s local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan&apos;s careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",3.85,17+,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']",2017-09-26,"snow,rape,investigation,native american reservation,neo western",PT1H47M,"[{'name': 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0647634/'}, {'name': 'Jeremy Renner', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719637/'}, {'name': 'Graham Greene', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001295/'}]","[{'name': 'Taylor Sheridan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792263/'}]","[{'name': 'Taylor Sheridan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792263/'}]",4.5,4.35

I saw Flight 93 and enjoyed it and I am very interested in all events surrounding September 11th, so this film appealed to me. Now, I must say that I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however, upon hearing this movie was nothing like an Oliver Stone film I decided to check it out.\n\nThe storyline for the film, as stated, was based on the stories of a few Port Authority police who survived the collapse of the building while being trapped for hours in the rubble. At the beginning we are introduced to each of the characters and their families. It&apos;s enough to get us involved with each of them but leaves enough room to elaborate as the film unfolds. The film moves rather nicely without going too fast or slow. The vast amount of the film takes place after the towers collapse while the men are trapped in the rubble. The story is told through the trapped police officers current situation as well as what their families are going through at the same time.\n\nI felt this story to be very natural and not Hollywood-ized, something I had been worried would happen. All the events seemed plausible, they didn&apos;t throw anything in for added drama. All of the characters were completely believable and you ended up loving all of them by the end. I will caution you though, there are some intense scenes in this movie so if you are unable to deal with some of the events from that day you may not want to see the film.\n\nThe cinematography and sound really aided this film. All of the filming was crisp and clean, the special effects were great and you could hardly tell this had been filmed after the towers were gone (the shots containing the towers that is). There were some great scenes from life in new york; shots of the skyline and the subway as well as some breathtaking aerials. The sound was spot on, you could feel the building collapse as the scenes unfolded on the screen. It was a great job all around.\n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was, it lived up to Flight 93, although it has an entirely different feel to it. This film is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn&apos;t meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 7}}",3.0,PG-13,"['Drama', 'History', 'Thriller']",2006-08-09,"disaster film,collapsing building,9 11,catastrophe,american police officer",PT2H9M,"[{'name': 'Nicolas Cage', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/'}, {'name': 'Michael Peña', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0671567/'}, {'name': 'Maria Bello', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004742/'}]","[{'name': 'Oliver Stone', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/'}]","[{'name': 'Andrea Berloff', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0075696/'}, {'name': 'John McLoughlin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2225418/'}, {'name': 'Donna McLoughlin', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2228493/'}]",3.0,3.3

The real slap in the face goes to those two, because it&apos;s evident this film was missing their magical touches, especially the fight scenes.\n\nHere, you have two directors in this one - Li Xi Jie and Zhang Zhu Lin, and Fang Lan and Liu Bayin as writers, who instead gave us 1980&apos;s slow-mo cheesy and sappy scenes. Some of the choreography, especially at the beginning, was just as bad as the writing and directing.\n\nAlthough the cinematography was up to par as the previous films, and the actual story had its merits, the rest of the production was a let-down of my expectations. Would I recommend this one? Well, if you&apos;re a fan of the franchise, it&apos;s a decent (but not great) origin story, so I&apos;d say yes.

This film evoked deep emotions to my core. The screenplay was perfection. The soundtrack was superb. The sets were authentic and noteworthy. The acting was spot on.\n\nThe only downside for most of the audience is the language, which is Polish. As far as I know, this is one of the least spoken of the main languages in the developed world, so most will have to read the subtitles or utilize the dubbing. And some of the dubbing is lost in translation, the phrases and slang are outdated (slightly) and many of the voice actors did not capture the intended emphasis or pauses as I would have desired. Notwithstanding, I was still profoundly moved by &apos;Forgotten Love&apos; (&apos;Znachor&apos;).\n\nSomething about the Polish culture must take some extra hard work to translate into a Western mindset, however I was extremely entertained. Some of the scenes actually reminded me of great epic films of yesteryear. There are glimpses of the handiwork of many a famous director. And I must reiterate the soundtrack was brilliant and very moving. Many aspects are award-worthy, and hopefully this receives some nominations.\n\nIf you have zero trouble with dubbed films, you absolutely must see this.
